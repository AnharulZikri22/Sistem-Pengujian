its a really good app if dont mind ads and limited skips its fine but it can be a bit slow sometimes and randomly turn off if you have a nokia like me  but apart from that ,0
so easy to use can set up playlists find music podcasts share interests i havent had an issue finding a recording artist i was looking for yet,0
you should fix this i play my favorite song in playlist but it play different songs1 star,0
pay for nothing but bugs and a service that wont work unless i hit shuffle play i cannot click on songs in my library and then actually play insteadthe app just freezes,0
absolutely crazy amazing spotify primume really makes the change,1
the last update has so many issues the navigation bar will disappear meaning the only way to stop a song or do anything is to kill the app everyone in the family has the same issue so this is clearly a new bug,0
spotify used to be a pretty good app when i first started using it but now its nothing without the premium we understand the company also gotta make money and im okay with the ads  but why this annoying thing that i cant choose a song to listen according to my wish  youre telling me that i have to listen to a whole playlist for that one song which is not even in the front  please fix this ,0
i have had a spotify premium account for the past three years and ive enjoyed the experience so much so that i upgraded to a family account but now the other members that i added on the plan do not have the lyrics feature but i do this doesnt make sense,0
spotify is now sucks because it doesnt let me listen to my songs ,0
just able to here some playlist of certain artist and era,1
excellent app for all world music thank you,1
one of the better music streaming platforms although the free version is steadily losing functionality that is migrated to the fee based subscription service,0
you can only listen on shuffle likewhy i really do miss the old spotifyt-t,0
i had music album and artist names on a longnote book for a long time over 400 titlesnow with spotify i only had to upload these lists on the app for easy access and listening to my favorite music mostly jazz,0
the app keeps crashing songs disappear had to make new accounts cause it wouldnt let me sign in even if i changed the password and now it just wont open im done peace out,0
best music player in the world it has alot music of whole world,1
all in one service that allows me to access my library across devices i love the ui as well as the easy to understand functionalities this app comes with,1
how do i refresh all my downloaded playlists at once after my 1 months trial has run out  ive put 10 back on all my playlists need refreshing but i cant find a refresh all button anywhere,0
one of the worst app  they are always concerned about money and premium  lots of advertisements and thirdly takes so long to open and the search list option takes half an hour to open  useless,0
its great app but now it keeps crashing smh,1
1 song and 3 ads go premium if u really want to listen music,0
nice to choose the music i like to listen to,1
i love spotifyso many options can spend hrs on there definitely recommend to everyone,1
plays a large variety of music not just the basic music that you hear over and over again on the radio,1
2022 0503 88mb size app better to use lite versions,0
i admit that this app was really good when the latest update wasnt there goshhhh spotify why cant i play i song that i want when i click a song from my playlist it will just play a preview of the song ugh this app really suck your app spotify sucks now you only want money only premium users can play what they want latest update suck i hate it ugh,0
i like the app but i hate hattteee when i try to find songs they are shuffled with others songs i dont like and also my playlist,0
it always says error everytime i subscribe to premium,0
super app great collection of music,1
everything was fine until recently player keeps freezing up and pausing for no reason making listening to any singular song almost impossible with how jittery its beingits like the era of cd skipping all over again,0
i cant get podcasts to play anymore i press play and nothing happens,0
its a very good app it has a lot of songs and its very easy to find artists you like,1
love this app a lot but its really speed down these past few months i have a brand new android phone so it isnt my device and spotify is the only issue my friends have the same problem an amazing app but the large load times just to open my liked songs is getting irritating otherwise i couldnt be happier with this service,0
i have used the spotify app for many years now and i enjoy the price as well as the selection of music and podcasts,1
very good but some music of artist is not there or not in all the languages they perform,0
my rating of 5 stars is mostly due to the way you let joe rogan do his podcast with the freedom to do it his way and the last podcast on the left is one of my favorites keep up the good work ,1
spotify is a good app i enjoy listening and using it but i hate how when im creating an playlist with looped songs it adds random songs i dont want in there and wont let me get rid of them all,1
too many ads thats irritating  i changed the song after finishing ads playing 2times that takes ads too much,0

im so disappointed with your service i try to play the artist lisa song money but sadly in some of your playlists the real artist has been replaced with an unauthorized song with an identical name we have been waiting for 4 days you to fix this but seems like no response from you hope you will fix this very soon,0
never thought digital could replace vinyl older and wiser amazing,1
i have a premium account on spotify and i did all the updates but i still dont have the lyrics,0
whenever too my mind to listened so im listening my favourite song in spotify that is too awesome app for songs like hindi korean chinese so i like it spotify,1
it is good because when you are doing work you can lisen to the songand you can play so games will the music is playing i hope you enjoyed the app ,1
a good music streaming platform just the ads suck and the amount they pay to artists is also low,0
love the service have been a premium member for almost a decade now the app has been very glitchy the past few months i will sort out my queue in a specific order but sometimes i leave the app and pause it and when i come back it shuffles the queue or clears it sometimes the miniplayer at the bottom of the page that shows whats playing and allows you to pause play or change songs will be missing ill have to close the app completely and go back into it and sometimes it takes a few tries,0
updates that others have doesnt seem to be applied to all like where are my lyrics also downloaded music doesnt always play with no internet,0
i wish it would play more of my original voice material,0
this is insanseeee love this no bugs this is the best feel free to download,1
enjoying the app the array of songs and other content is great the suggestions are spot on,1
the one song i want to hear cannot play even the album is no longer available can you please bring it backits tuks senganga- monopoly album the song name is joko ya hao by tuks lesego madok please,0
easy to use nice that premium and paying in general is optional,1
i used to love spotify but now the same issue came up twice i cannot play some particular songs logging outin isnt helping at all reinstalling the app helps for a while but then the issue comes back please fix this asap i really want my music back,0
its been awhile i have use this and i love this but i gave it four star for some kind of issue Â ,1
lots of ads,0
can we see a search for songs based on same title so if im on a song why cant the three dots option have search on artist who did the same song plus i would love to know who was the original owner of the song credits doesnt always make it clear who introduced it first etc why cant we see searching on years if i know in 2000 between june and august i heard a song that was released can we search by inputting the dates a song originally was published i know licensing changes etc but,0
cant even listen to the music i want to its all just recomended stuff terrible app,0
best music streaming service out there imo the app is very easy to use everything is very smooth and fluid the playlists are pretty accurate most of the time sound quality its excellent a paid subscription makes the experience even better,1
the app is good but mine doesnt show lyrics and i have done everything the support center have written but still no lyrics,0
wont work offline mode i have premium account and entire playlists downloaded and when i put it on offline mode and shutdown data or will only play 1 of 100 songs super weird cause ive always used it like that to save data and battery and that didnt happen before,0
excellent app i enjoy it so much i can listen to just about anything including sermons by some great teachers love the music,1
they hit it right on the spotify excellent  jason,1
great app and music choses top class,1
grate and lots of diffrent songs,0
o nice music app,1
app cant not open without shutting down my phone ive tried changing my password restarting my phone removing google smart lock redownloading the app several times and nothing helps does not open the app at all,0
thought this would be better than listening to youtube but there are just as many commercialsif you pay for no commercials your literally the enemy of every one else who uses this appwhat kind of simp gives these a-holes money to listen to free music,0
the music is great but what pisses me off is the tiny yet important details i have been trying to login to spotify on my pc for weeks now but i do not remember my username or password and the app doesnt have a section where i can get that information this sucks and i wont be renewing my premium subscription,0
im starting to question the sanity behind paying for a musicpodcast service that wont let you play a podcast or even 1 song without shutting off if you get annoyed easily cant constantly hit a play button or want to listen to a full song without interruption find a different app to listen to i want to toss my phone out of the window multiple times a day because of this app,0
not satisfiedtoo much glitch,0
was good now frustrating to use app never loads only plays the playlist i had last listened too uninstaller and reinstalled and still having a hard time loading always a black screen now not good wont pay premium if it continues,0
got everything also build your own playlist,1
best app i just loved it giving five star,1
great applove the playlists,1
its nice to listen the musicsongs and prodcast its really amazing,1
most recent update has ruined the app when i play a song the progress bar doesnt show so no control over songs music stops randomly now and the shuffle algorithm is terrible always adds the same songs youve listened to at the top of the list its honestly deterring me from continuing to use spotify,0
amazing sound but if you dont have premium you get adds during the times where your expressing your feelings or jaming out so id recommend getting premium as well as music there is also podcast and spotify will also be able to remind you beyond that you can make specialised playlist for certain things or search up and listen to pre-existing playlist made by others also it can recommend songs that are similar to your favorites,1
started having issues with this app about 2 months ago continually stops in the middle of a song have to keep restarting its annoying,0
the app is good itself but there are way to many ads right now im listening to my 9th ad in a row and it happens like every other song the only reason i have not deleted the app is because i already have so many playlists i dont want to recreate,0
last update has completely bricked the app seriously considering unsubbbing the service gets worse every update oh and the shuffle keeps repeating the same downloaded songs about 10 songs later in a list of thousands,0
always have the music i wanna listen to had the family plan for years,1
i love spotifys premium version but these days i cant seem to gat premium i hope you could fix the prepaid option for premium because its having a lot of errors i am really disappointed and annoyed by it,0
shuffle keeps repeating same song back to back or every other or gets stuck playing the same 4 songs out of a playlist of hundreds now having issues with my volume constantly being lowered automatically cancelled my premium until these issues are resolved not paying for the major inconvenience of a broken product,0
the app is always crashing always has trouble loading podcasts the worst is when an add comes on and after the add is done the podcast im listening to skips right to the end total waste of time,0
can no longer manually select a time position when in the notification bar of the phone often playing one song but showing its still playing the previous one,0
newest update makes the app crash all the time i cant even use it on my phone efficiently anymore and its just sad when i pay a subscription every month for good music service oh my wrapped 2021 still isnt fixed either even after talking to their it for ages,0
