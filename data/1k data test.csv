Well Spotify you are making me angry and nothing more I will say just make it so that I can listen to any part of the song by taping instead of you doesn't just let me touch it,1
"Dumbest update ever. I am giving this thing a 1 star because it doesn't have the basic features of a music app. For an example for I can't rewind or forward while hearing a music, We can't see queueof the next songs to be played, and much much MORE. So see forward to fix these problems...",0

I'm unimpressed with new updates üò¢because I want listen order and I can't to pay for the package but now no the option for backward also it's so disappointing. Please don't do it. Normal type spotify I like most. I can't play my favorite song any time... It's too much uncomfortable. So we can't listen any song the why did we install? And I'm seriously hurt it's updating made my day worst. So much pain I can't here my favorite like songs. When old version come I will install. So I'm uninstalle.,0

Good,1
"as a music enthusiast , i love spotify but it gets even better if you subsribe to premium plan. as for those who don't subscribe, these user ( which was me as well ) experience lots of unskipable ads and i hope spotify would please at least lessen the amount. the premium plan is affordable and worth it as well as the experience it's giving is incredible. your songs may be uninterrupted and you can enjoy your artists without any barriers :D !",1
It's good,1
All the songs I love at my finger tips!,1
"I had downloded it 3 months ago. All was fine, but why they always give suggestions to go premium in between. Ok atleast u display it on the screen but don't give suggestions after some songs. But although it's a kind of a awsome music app that I ever felt. ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫",0
"Terrible app. It crashes every few minutes and i have done everything recommended to fix the problem (cleared cache, reinstalled, etc ) but it still will not play for more than a few minutes at a time before stopping dead.

Constantly glitches and app wont open when I'm paying alot of money for it and my family account. Might have to try Amazon music.,1
Too many ads. Unfortunately I can't afford to pay for this so I'm stuck with ads. Every two songs you get ads. Also they play the same set of songs. I'll hear the same song at least three times in a couple hours. Switching to something else.,0

Spotify needs fixing because when you put a song onto your playlist it plays straight away and that's wrong and should not be happening and put Spotify back to the old way instead of the new way not happy with Spotify I will never using Spotify again until it gets fixed and back to normal,0
Nothing to complain it's simple and I love it.,1
You dont have to ask i fall in love with this app i like good music....it just knows how to keep you on the go.playlists are awesome,1
love itttt,1
I absolutely love it I don't know I've been in the dark or something and I didn't realize you could do this but having the music I love. I really like Christian all sorts of but mostly Rock they really fit the bill. Most often they can find what I'm looking for some of the things I can't but well that's okay I guess working on it. I highly suggest it,1
Better then Pandora now but now there a glitch that been happening since the PS5 came out where it will eventually get stuck on ads and you can't listen anymore until you pay them or restart the app which doesn't work at all on the PS5 console so you need to use your phone to begin with. What a cheap and greedy way to make money spotify,0
In simple word horrible!!!!!.....as no option is there so I've to give 1 star otherwise I would give 0 star,0

"Antes se tenia mejor libertad a la hora de tener el modo gratis, pero es entendible es el modo gratis, no vengamos a mandar. Pero lo que no se perdona es la mala optimizacion que se tiene desde hace tiempo. Las canciones tardan en cargar, en si todo el sistema se ha vuelto lento y no es por el internet, usando datos es igual de lento. Puede llevarse hasta 2 minutos cargando. Les importa mas actualizar la interfaz que la calidad del usuario. Se han desviado de la optimizacion por completo.",0
Unprecedented,1
"Spotify app on Android is trash. It will not play right and most music I pick won't play. Have have Spotify on my PlayStation and works fine, but the app on the phone is trash.",0
"It stops playing randomly and will often repeat the same short cycle of songs in a playlist. Also, customer support has not been helpful. They just say to restart and reinstall, which I've done several times. And now they make an audiobook require payment WHILE I was listening to it?? Here I thought it was included in premium up to like 12 hours or something. Greedy corpos. I pay them enough for this waste of data üôÑ Edit: I edit everytime these bugs occur. Also, why is it so painfully slow now?",0
It would be five stars but sometimes when I'm trying to listen to a song it plays suggested instead of the song.,0
Spotify: If you listen to these 2 adds then youll get 30 minutes of add free time. Me: *watching both adds* Spotify: Oh and i forgot to mention that there is a 93% chance you will have to restart the app because the adds glitch out and keep playing over and over or after the song you listen to there is an 80% chance that another 4 adds will play. Me: *switches to pandora*,0
I've used Spotify for 6 years and love it!! It has all kinds of music even when I into heavier genres of metal it surprised me how much they have.,1
Too many adds,0

New Terms of Service Are Terrifying,0
Trying to scroll through app brings back up to black history. Racist much,0
"Downgraded to free from premium and it's basically unusable. Playlists can't even be viewed in a list. Doesn't play the songs you ask it to play. Plays something entirely different. When you actually get the song you want to play, it starts somewhere in the middle. Premium is not worth $11/month for how little I use it. You would think they would have different tiers. I wouldn't mind $5/month for a usable app with ads, for instance.",0
worst app for music u can't skip within your playlist and a ton of ads,0
Its good overall but i still cant pair my spotify to my ps5.,1
Good,1
"Spotify is a great app that I use when I'm bored and want to listen to songs. But the thing that bothers me the most is the fact that you get suggested songs when you're playing a song in your liked songs. This is extremely frustrating because I can get 6 or more suggested songs in a row, but the only thing I want to listen to is my playlist of liked songs. Nonetheless, great app, and keep up the great work!",0
Great job! At last it has been updated that you are not able to play music without membership..üëçüôÇ,1
"Look, I'm gonna be real. The only reason I even still use spotify is because I refuse to move everything to youtube music. Spotify used to be great, I even had a 5-star review for it. But now the shuffle function barely even works. Especially with the liked songs playlist. ""Oh you set the category to electropop? Nope!! You're getting indie!!"" Like I said, it barely works, I set the category to something, it plays a whole different category. And the algorithm? It plays the same 5 songs. Fix it <3",0
"Dear Spotify, Please, for the love of all that is good, stop forcing through updates that break half of the useful features in the app. The app is practically unusable after the April 5 update, and I specifically had auto updates turned off for this reason. Yet, somehow an update still goes through and breaks half of what I used the app for (quite literally, half). I've used this service for years; it's phenomenal, groundbreaking technology that revolutionized the way we listen to music.",0
What happened to the autoplay?,0
Song OMG,0
Would be 0 star you literally can't even listen to what you want to without paying you make a playlist press play and it plays songs that aren't even in your playlist and you can't skip the songs without paying either,0

"I love Spotify's versatility, the varied choices of things the listen too, downloading and listening offline, being able to listen to files from my phone, etc. It just gets buggy sometimes and doesn't see files on my phone one day that it opened the day before, when nothing has changed. It also recently stopped letting me add tracks from my local files to my queue, so now I have to add them to a playlist and delete them as and when I'm listening. Annoying when I'm running a class or workshop.",0

"I swear this is the app that help save my life. When I was very depressed I used spotify to help regulate my feelings and it helped calm me down, so it saved my life I wanted to escape this world because it was so much.

"For the most part I really like Spotify. My 2 biggest issues that led me to leave only 3 stars is that I can't get Spotify to play my next unlistened to podcast. It does its own thing and I end up having to start a podcast on my own because it inevitably starts a podcast that has already been listened to. Also, I recently was offered a 2 month trial of Spotify. No commercials it said for our premium Spotify. Yet I still hear commercials. So I cancelled premium. Don't pay for it you'll waste $$.",0

Spotify has gotten me through 9+ formidable years of my life. It is my go to music streaming service and it has helped expand my music taste palette. Never any advertisements with premium. Spotify Wrapped something I look forward to most every year. I love making a new playlist for every month.,1
Complete selections of choice of my kind of music.,1
"To many ads, literally in the MIDDLE of the song im listening to there's so many ads popping up, very frustrating",0
It is a great app!! Very user friendly!,1
"Genuinely turning into a horrible app, lyrics aren't showing, lag,",0
"I had to change my rating from 5 to 3 stars because I am really disgusted from Spotify policy. I am paying for family plan for a long time already. I lost my credit card so I had to block it, so one payment to spotify did not get through immediately. I repeated payment in couple of hours, but anyway my plan was canceled , everybody from family group kicked out. Lot of invitation and logging stuff from everybody in gropup needed again. Why all of this? It's bonus for paying customers?",0
"You have lost the plot with the amount of ads guys, it's more ads than music. Also the app itself just seems to be getting worse",0

"Buggy in offline mode, sometimes difficult to use without a strong internet connection.",0
"I pay for premium, but they keep making it worse for local file users. Many of my favorite songs aren't available on Spotify, so I play it from the local file on my phone. However, after the recent updates, I can't just tap on the local file song to play it. I have to queue it up to play next. Even then, can't press the 3 dot option to press ""add to queue"" like the other songs anymore. I have to do the slide function. They keep making it harder to listen to music they don't offer.",0
App stops playing music too often. Literally have to close app and restart and it dies the same thing. I cleared the cache and Uninstalled and reinstalled. The same thing. This is a new phone. Does it on my tablet as well. More annoying then the ads,0
I wanted to try Spotify to see if it's worth paying for so I did the free trial. It was a 3 month trial so I was worried I'd forget the date to know if I should cancel. After 3 months I realized it's not worth the extra money. The money doesn't even go towards the artists. I was never notified with an email like they said I would be to let me know the free trial was over. They just charged me! Then I cancelled and they charged me AGAIN. They only refunded one payment even after I told them.,0
Before spotify was so good but now i think ill uninstall it its so frustating ull have to listen to the song that u dont want also and u cant even repeat your favourite song without viewing their add so friends dont download it......... It'll make u mad and angry at the same time like me üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨,0

"I don't know how y'all broke this app's code on mobile but you broke it. For one, there is no way to access a playlist. You can only access previews so you can't even pick a song you want from the playlist. Two, when you select the song itself it plays a completely different song. Idk how y'all broke this but you did.",0
"The new DJ features are very cool, especially with the fact that I like a variety of music, it's good to set the mood.",1
"I used to love this app, but it's getting worse and worse. It used to remember which podcast episode I was listening but now I have to scroll through 500 episodes to find the next one EVERY TIME! On the music side, apparently Spotify does not know the meaning of the word shuffle.",0
very worst ü§¨ü§¨,0

"I've come back to Spotify having left for sometime after being unhappy with the user experience. However, I decided to come back based on the cost Vs experience of YouTube Music...... and Im glad I did!! Audio Books now included, better layout, AI DJ....all fantastic. You'll have me for a good while now....It looks great, neatly laid out and a far better user experience than my previous subscription.",1
"These dumb devlopers are telling that they are improving the app but they are making it worse than every app in this world 1)I cannot go to any part of any song randomly,If I want then I have to do premium. 2)I cannot play songs in order,If I want I have to do premium, and that dumb smart shuffle that has to be in premium and there is not that repeat option only,and if I want then I have to do it manually,before these were not there.

"I wish I could give this app five stars. I have a premium account and use it daily. But for some reason Spotify feels the need to change and remove features. No, I don't want ""smart shuffle,"" I want the radio from playlist that always existed. Why was it removed? Why was the ""like"" system changed to the ""plus"" system? I don't get it. Stop removing and changing features that everyone uses. At this point it's clear Spotify doesn't care about its users. Going to cancel my account if nothing changes",0

"I have used and loved Spotify for years. I joined back when you needed an invite from a band and I've never left. But let me tell you how quick I almost cancelled and uninstalled today!! The app keeps forcing itself open when my headphones are connected. Over and over again, even when I am attempting to use another audio app. This is the first time I've ever disabled Spotify on my phone. Searched through settings and found nothing to explain the auto/force play happening with Bluetooth.",0
Just don't download this app it's not worth even downloading for once. U people only care about money nothing else better search for other streaming platforms or just use YouTube but don't download this horrible app those who have already have downloaded delete it or switch bcz they won't let u listen to even 1 complete song and 1 star is to just post this review or wouldn't have given at all,0
Very user friendly and cheaper than other apps that do the same thing but they do not give the reception and clarity of Spotify üòÅ,0
Worst,0
Plz don't use this app. You can use Blackhole music app,0
Since I lost YouTube Premium Spotify already is starting to feel like the aya to go when you need music. It feels like a ad every so 20-30 Minutes isn't as bad as it would seem. I personally use it almost everyday and I would say I am looking into the premium version.,0
Beautiful app,1
"Such a money hunger person. We now cannot play the song we want to, can't repeat, can't make queue. It become worst app to recommend",0
for some odd reason i am unable to access my downloaded playlists while offline wich kills the reason for me going premium,0
"I am not able to forward the song and play whatever part i want to listen. Lyrics option are disabled and lots of ads are coming after every one song . Why to pay for premium for such basic features Also cant play in order it always ask for premium. Customer service also doesnot respond it been 2 months rhey have not responded to my email .

Spotify is a digital music service that gives you access to millions of songs Now that I think of it It only gives access to people how have premium I am seriously annoyed by the amount of restrictions Spotify nowadays have madeYou can't play songs in a row You can't even forward the song can't listen to more than 3 songs in a row because of ads You also can't listen to your own playlist song for that also you have to premium Seriously Spotify It's a shame for the countless restrictions you have,0
"Very very bad experience,not even shuffle any song even can not play my favour songs, premium itni zaruri ho gayi ki log aise review de rehe hai fir bhi koi changes nahi",0
"The algorithm sucks. Every mix is composed of songs I've already added. You can no longer just search for similar tracks to a specific song, that function is replaced by an AI DJ that just plays you your Liked Songs in a feedback loop. Not to mention that the ads are borderline abusive (deafeningly loud, repetetive, every 15 minutes) if you don't pay for premium. Editing playlists is a nightmare.",0

We can't even move backwards to a song without using premium just pathetic you play ads every 2 ads and still we can't even do basic functions in a musicplayer,0
Glitchy. Basic usage bugs. Did they test it at all? If you're scrolling through a library and get to the bottom it all disappears. And you can't scroll back up. Skipping a song right and the hit box of the button is off. So it skips back instead. These found in just one evening. Eat you own dog food Spotify!,0
"I love everything about spotify. I bet my daily phone activity comprises of 95% of playing music on spotify. Even if I'm playing games. I mute my games and listen to spotify instead. Although, it would be lovely to see friends' listening activity on mobile soon",0

I see what they are doing here they have gotten their large pool of loyal premium customers and now they are just making us non premium listeners listen to ads instead of our favourite music and now we can't even choos order in which we would listen to songs and the most basic of the basic feature that we can't even navigate to the favourite part of our song and now what ? Fm is now better than the free Spotify!,0
One of the third class app I have ever used and unwanted add and you can't switch song manually,0

I love spotify!! But everytime you change something you take something away.... The previous statement is from my original review. Again we've updated and you guys make something harder to use.

"Great for listening to all your music. One problem, ads CONSTANTLY. Listen to one song, ad, ad, ad. Listen to two songs, ad, ad, ad. Listen to one song again, ad, ad, ad, ad. See the problem? You listen to more ads then you do music. Practically ENTICING you to pay for premium. This is a scummy way to do things, I've been listening on Spotify for years and as of recent the ads are WAY more consistent and annoying to listening to. At this point better off with YouTube.",0
I cant download Spotify normally anymore it cancelled my downloading pls fix this,0
"This app was best but now it's not. This is because you're making this app so bad that i can't even play the fav parts of any song Or put it in repeat. You know everyone can't buy the premium plan because there're many people below 18 who don't have money to spend. And also, no one is interested to buy ur premium plans.

Very bad experience the latest update is worse it doesn't make any sense . You can't just stop the users to play what they want for just premium.,0
Waste of time,0
Everyone know what it is!,1
"Seems that the like song feature has been removed. The last update seemed to have removed this ability from the app. Before you were able to search a song, tap on the 3 dots to the far right of the song, a drop down menu shows up and the very first feature should be like song. It has been removed, the only way to like a song is to play that song then while it is playing you can like the song. Please fix this feature and add it back.",0
Love it,1

Worst App Ever App Dev's Can't Even Be Called Dev's They're rather beggars,0
I have been using Spotify since 2yrs and it really was a very great app but recently after the updates it isn't that good. There are many features which have been disabled in this app now which were free before And and every single time it asks you to buy premium. So I had to buy premium since then it's working fine,0
Acha sound hai,1
Bad app don't insta,0
Yas,0
Worst app ever ....it's was good ..but now they r asking for premium to do anything...they might even ask money to install ..and for a single click too...too much of ads!! Irritating app nowadays...guys uninstall it as soon as possible please...,0
"Worst app, as just for the sake of money. They are removing even normal features like forward or next song and asking for premium.",0
"Is there an option to giv 0 stars? Cuz that's how bad the app is ;-; legit sucks, plz uninstall nd go with someother good app",0

Just masterpiece,1
I have this one issue where the app logs into someone elses acccount every time and says i can use it abroad for 14 days. This account is not evan on my device its my dads email but it does not have a spotify account i tried to clear cache and delete data but neither works i have also tried reinstalling the app but nothing works please fix this.,0
Such an irritating app I am going to uninstall it. Continously showing ads and asking for premium every time I try to repeat a song or or go backwards or forwards in the song,0
"I am a Old Spotify user and According to my experience it is a very awesome, amazing and mind blowing app because, it has many points to become Helping such like very easy U.I and outstanding music audio and podcasts quality Equalizer according to our mood given playlist. And it haven't any more problem but I recommend to improve their premium membership something low because it demands gone low somewhere for that point üëâ. THANX",1

"I like this app, it is useful when I am studying and also to relax my mind. However, I would like to understand why the music stops when I'm listening to the music. It's a very annoying situation. I started having this problem in September and I thought that it was necessary to update but nothing changed after that. You must improve this issue. I am not the only one who faces this problem.",0
I don't know in every each month first the app is very slow to open why??? Am I didn't purchase the premium,0

"I've been an avid spotify user for years, and it feels like this new update has fixed everything I hated about the free phone version. I was very disappointed with the phone version due to the lack of control on what you can play, the increased ads, and the automatic shuffle. The new update lets me do all of that. The only issue I have is that spotify no longer works with my headphones. My headphones were working fine, and one day, my headphones suddenly stopped working with spotify and youtube.",0
"Wouldn't let me unpin a playlist so I had to delete the playlist, and then when I deleted the pin playlist it still said there was four playlists pinned.",0

"Once you're verified as a student, it's not as though Spotify starts discounting your existing Premium subscription from your next payment. You need to get a new subscription for Premium Student, but it doesn't even allow you to schedule the transfer over to the Premium Student plan when your next bill is due. Nope, you'll be prompted pay for the new student subscription straight away, even if you have a month left on your existing (full-price) Premium subscription. They must catch so many out.",0

This app was really good at the start and now it is the most worst app I've ever downloaded I loved this app at first but know I literally just hate it and the spotify community had literally just changed I recommended everyone to download this app but now all people hate it and almost every review of this app had given 1 star but the app shows that the people had given 3.8 stars as their review do guys agree?!?!!??!?!?üíØüíØ,0
"I love it at first time but there are few reasons to hate it now 1. Cannot move foward or backwards 2.

Love this app so much but there's one problem. When I scroll to the bottom of my liked songs it just removes all of them (Not actually remove them) and will just say liked songs will appear here and I've tried closing the app but that didn't work so I don't know if this is a glitch but it's really starting to piss me off.,0
