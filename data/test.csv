probably the most frustrating app in the store crashes often many features just dont work like add to queue doesnt even work im a paid subscriber and quite disappointed,0
i like this but the new update i dont like it its bcuz u have to shuffle ur playlist its kinda bit unfair but its ok its still playing ur playlist,0
pretty good but its crashing a lot,1
i opened a discover taylor swift thing and now it broke the app im reinstalling but if its broken youre gonna get a real angry phone call soon,0
it could have a shuffle all button,0
nice,1
its been mentally helpful to my depression thank god for spotify,0
im very satisfied with all the options and how easy the app is to use,1
audio tracks were already downloaded but cannot be played when i go offline mode,0
like it,1
plesse fix the latest update which broke numerous things like now playing bar on samsung application became unstable and occasionally stops playing,0
im changing my review frome 5 to 3 just because they removed eisenfunks song called pong,0
its a really good app if dont mind ads and limited skips its fine but it can be a bit slow sometimes and randomly turn off if you have a nokia like me  but apart from that ,0
so easy to use can set up playlists find music podcasts share interests i havent had an issue finding a recording artist i was looking for yet,0
you should fix this i play my favorite song in playlist but it play different songs1 star,0
pay for nothing but bugs and a service that wont work unless i hit shuffle play i cannot click on songs in my library and then actually play insteadthe app just freezes,0
absolutely crazy amazing spotify primume really makes the change,1
the last update has so many issues the navigation bar will disappear meaning the only way to stop a song or do anything is to kill the app everyone in the family has the same issue so this is clearly a new bug,0
spotify used to be a pretty good app when i first started using it but now its nothing without the premium we understand the company also gotta make money and im okay with the ads  but why this annoying thing that i cant choose a song to listen according to my wish  youre telling me that i have to listen to a whole playlist for that one song which is not even in the front  please fix this ,0
i have had a spotify premium account for the past three years and ive enjoyed the experience so much so that i upgraded to a family account but now the other members that i added on the plan do not have the lyrics feature but i do this doesnt make sense,0
spotify is now sucks because it doesnt let me listen to my songs ,0
just able to here some playlist of certain artist and era,1
excellent app for all world music thank you,1
one of the better music streaming platforms although the free version is steadily losing functionality that is migrated to the fee based subscription service,0
you can only listen on shuffle likewhy i really do miss the old spotifyt-t,0
i had music album and artist names on a longnote book for a long time over 400 titlesnow with spotify i only had to upload these lists on the app for easy access and listening to my favorite music mostly jazz,0
the app keeps crashing songs disappear had to make new accounts cause it wouldnt let me sign in even if i changed the password and now it just wont open im done peace out,0
best music player in the world it has alot music of whole world,1
all in one service that allows me to access my library across devices i love the ui as well as the easy to understand functionalities this app comes with,1
how do i refresh all my downloaded playlists at once after my 1 months trial has run out  ive put 10 back on all my playlists need refreshing but i cant find a refresh all button anywhere,0
one of the worst app  they are always concerned about money and premium  lots of advertisements and thirdly takes so long to open and the search list option takes half an hour to open  useless,0
its great app but now it keeps crashing smh,1
1 song and 3 ads go premium if u really want to listen music,0
nice to choose the music i like to listen to,1
i love spotifyso many options can spend hrs on there definitely recommend to everyone,1
plays a large variety of music not just the basic music that you hear over and over again on the radio,1
2022 0503 88mb size app better to use lite versions,0
i admit that this app was really good when the latest update wasnt there goshhhh spotify why cant i play i song that i want when i click a song from my playlist it will just play a preview of the song ugh this app really suck your app spotify sucks now you only want money only premium users can play what they want latest update suck i hate it ugh,0
i like the app but i hate hattteee when i try to find songs they are shuffled with others songs i dont like and also my playlist,0
it always says error everytime i subscribe to premium,0
super app great collection of music,1
everything was fine until recently player keeps freezing up and pausing for no reason making listening to any singular song almost impossible with how jittery its beingits like the era of cd skipping all over again,0
i cant get podcasts to play anymore i press play and nothing happens,0
its a very good app it has a lot of songs and its very easy to find artists you like,1
love this app a lot but its really speed down these past few months i have a brand new android phone so it isnt my device and spotify is the only issue my friends have the same problem an amazing app but the large load times just to open my liked songs is getting irritating otherwise i couldnt be happier with this service,0
i have used the spotify app for many years now and i enjoy the price as well as the selection of music and podcasts,1
very good but some music of artist is not there or not in all the languages they perform,0
my rating of 5 stars is mostly due to the way you let joe rogan do his podcast with the freedom to do it his way and the last podcast on the left is one of my favorites keep up the good work ,1
spotify is a good app i enjoy listening and using it but i hate how when im creating an playlist with looped songs it adds random songs i dont want in there and wont let me get rid of them all,1
too many ads thats irritating  i changed the song after finishing ads playing 2times that takes ads too much,0
dear spotify users we appreciate your loyalty and support towards our platform as a result we are introducing a new subscription tier spotify premium pro that offers even more benefits and exclusive features here are some of the exciting features of spotify premium pro 1 higher quality streaming at 320 kbps audio 2 ad-free listening experience across all your devices 3 access to exclusive podcasts and music soundtracks we hope that you will find these new features helpful in enhanci,1
besides the adds it wasnt horrible but after joe rogan episodes were removed fo no reason i cant,0
great app  love the layout  must get,1
im so disappointed with your service i try to play the artist lisa song money but sadly in some of your playlists the real artist has been replaced with an unauthorized song with an identical name we have been waiting for 4 days you to fix this but seems like no response from you hope you will fix this very soon,0
never thought digital could replace vinyl older and wiser amazing,1
i have a premium account on spotify and i did all the updates but i still dont have the lyrics,0
whenever too my mind to listened so im listening my favourite song in spotify that is too awesome app for songs like hindi korean chinese so i like it spotify,1
it is good because when you are doing work you can lisen to the songand you can play so games will the music is playing i hope you enjoyed the app ,1
a good music streaming platform just the ads suck and the amount they pay to artists is also low,0
love the service have been a premium member for almost a decade now the app has been very glitchy the past few months i will sort out my queue in a specific order but sometimes i leave the app and pause it and when i come back it shuffles the queue or clears it sometimes the miniplayer at the bottom of the page that shows whats playing and allows you to pause play or change songs will be missing ill have to close the app completely and go back into it and sometimes it takes a few tries,0
updates that others have doesnt seem to be applied to all like where are my lyrics also downloaded music doesnt always play with no internet,0
i wish it would play more of my original voice material,0
this is insanseeee love this no bugs this is the best feel free to download,1
enjoying the app the array of songs and other content is great the suggestions are spot on,1
the one song i want to hear cannot play even the album is no longer available can you please bring it backits tuks senganga- monopoly album the song name is joko ya hao by tuks lesego madok please,0
easy to use nice that premium and paying in general is optional,1
i used to love spotify but now the same issue came up twice i cannot play some particular songs logging outin isnt helping at all reinstalling the app helps for a while but then the issue comes back please fix this asap i really want my music back,0
its been awhile i have use this and i love this but i gave it four star for some kind of issue  ,1
lots of ads,0
can we see a search for songs based on same title so if im on a song why cant the three dots option have search on artist who did the same song plus i would love to know who was the original owner of the song credits doesnt always make it clear who introduced it first etc why cant we see searching on years if i know in 2000 between june and august i heard a song that was released can we search by inputting the dates a song originally was published i know licensing changes etc but,0
cant even listen to the music i want to its all just recomended stuff terrible app,0
best music streaming service out there imo the app is very easy to use everything is very smooth and fluid the playlists are pretty accurate most of the time sound quality its excellent a paid subscription makes the experience even better,1
the app is good but mine doesnt show lyrics and i have done everything the support center have written but still no lyrics,0
wont work offline mode i have premium account and entire playlists downloaded and when i put it on offline mode and shutdown data or will only play 1 of 100 songs super weird cause ive always used it like that to save data and battery and that didnt happen before,0
excellent app i enjoy it so much i can listen to just about anything including sermons by some great teachers love the music,1
they hit it right on the spotify excellent  jason,1
great app and music choses top class,1
grate and lots of diffrent songs,0
o nice music app,1
app cant not open without shutting down my phone ive tried changing my password restarting my phone removing google smart lock redownloading the app several times and nothing helps does not open the app at all,0
thought this would be better than listening to youtube but there are just as many commercialsif you pay for no commercials your literally the enemy of every one else who uses this appwhat kind of simp gives these a-holes money to listen to free music,0
the music is great but what pisses me off is the tiny yet important details i have been trying to login to spotify on my pc for weeks now but i do not remember my username or password and the app doesnt have a section where i can get that information this sucks and i wont be renewing my premium subscription,0
im starting to question the sanity behind paying for a musicpodcast service that wont let you play a podcast or even 1 song without shutting off if you get annoyed easily cant constantly hit a play button or want to listen to a full song without interruption find a different app to listen to i want to toss my phone out of the window multiple times a day because of this app,0
not satisfiedtoo much glitch,0
was good now frustrating to use app never loads only plays the playlist i had last listened too uninstaller and reinstalled and still having a hard time loading always a black screen now not good wont pay premium if it continues,0
got everything also build your own playlist,1
best app i just loved it giving five star,1
great applove the playlists,1
its nice to listen the musicsongs and prodcast its really amazing,1
most recent update has ruined the app when i play a song the progress bar doesnt show so no control over songs music stops randomly now and the shuffle algorithm is terrible always adds the same songs youve listened to at the top of the list its honestly deterring me from continuing to use spotify,0
amazing sound but if you dont have premium you get adds during the times where your expressing your feelings or jaming out so id recommend getting premium as well as music there is also podcast and spotify will also be able to remind you beyond that you can make specialised playlist for certain things or search up and listen to pre-existing playlist made by others also it can recommend songs that are similar to your favorites,1
started having issues with this app about 2 months ago continually stops in the middle of a song have to keep restarting its annoying,0
the app is good itself but there are way to many ads right now im listening to my 9th ad in a row and it happens like every other song the only reason i have not deleted the app is because i already have so many playlists i dont want to recreate,0
last update has completely bricked the app seriously considering unsubbbing the service gets worse every update oh and the shuffle keeps repeating the same downloaded songs about 10 songs later in a list of thousands,0
always have the music i wanna listen to had the family plan for years,1
i love spotifys premium version but these days i cant seem to gat premium i hope you could fix the prepaid option for premium because its having a lot of errors i am really disappointed and annoyed by it,0
shuffle keeps repeating same song back to back or every other or gets stuck playing the same 4 songs out of a playlist of hundreds now having issues with my volume constantly being lowered automatically cancelled my premium until these issues are resolved not paying for the major inconvenience of a broken product,0
the app is always crashing always has trouble loading podcasts the worst is when an add comes on and after the add is done the podcast im listening to skips right to the end total waste of time,0
can no longer manually select a time position when in the notification bar of the phone often playing one song but showing its still playing the previous one,0
newest update makes the app crash all the time i cant even use it on my phone efficiently anymore and its just sad when i pay a subscription every month for good music service oh my wrapped 2021 still isnt fixed either even after talking to their it for ages,0
excellent service super quality nice music from all around the world,1
great app especially for podcast listening lol lefties are big mad that joe is having open conversations about whats going on  ,1
i cant play my downloaded songs offline any more start playing songs i dont like neither know once my data is on i hate this app now  rubbish,0
great music selection,1
love this,1
a new updaye and same issue as below last time i had to contact support to fix it used to love it a few weeks ago after an update i stopped seeing a notification in my pull down menu the app is also switching to playing on the phone after i turned the car off post bluetooth neither of these were ever an issue i changed nothing about my phone setup,0
couldnt live without spotify use it everyday use it with my kids listen to it at work at home and in the car love,1
i do really like spotify but when im playing a song it wont pop up can you fix that and also the recommendations thing you add for my mixes please remove it its so annoying,0
i dont normally have issues with the app i subscribe but my phone just did the update and now i cant use the spotify feature on my pioneer headunit i need to roll back the update,0
facing an issue that app is just crashing while song is just played phone vivo v21e plan individual premium,0
fabulous ,1
just go ahead and make this app paid you cant even use it to listen to music without premium,0
no ads just music,0
15 ads in a row if i have to sit through that much i should be able to listen to my playlists,0
superb didnt know such a app existed wish the player would delete my recently played though great standalone app,0
i really like this app its very helpful when i can find songs on youtube and i like that i can hear my music for 30 minutes with no adds there are no bugs with it after all i really like it i hope this could help some people out there,1
i can enjoy the music i choose,1
really loved this app and only used this for all music but now the thing just stops when my screen lock or when i go out of the app pathetic i will not pay for this if this is the way it will be,0
i love having spotify but this last update has kinda ruined the app for me completely unable to connect to my alexa device which is one of these main ways i listen to spotify,0
this app is 100 one that i cannot live without on my phone if you have premium your experience is highly enhanced and refined to your tastes this is my favorite music app,1
not working properly when i try to play my song it will play totally different song and also not showing me playlist and i cant able to jump on previous song very poor experience,0
i love this app as it has all my fav songs,1
i love this app,1
wide selection of music do its easy to keep track of favorites and find new ones plus it really customized to your personal tastes,1
spotify is an excellent music appi just love this,1
has a weird bug where you queue a song go to play a different song and it will skip to the next song in the queue you have to press it twice however this doesnt remove the song from the queue,0
ad scams for 30mins asking to play but after ad it cant claim it,0
good music app,1
i like that most of the songs are here and playlists are so fun to make i dont have any problems on it in web chrome computer butspotify app on phonett i cant play my playlist start to bottom the only option is shuffle  it is so unecessary i cant even view my friends playlist description fully  please dont make shuffle the only way to play the playlist please oh and also why do i need to be in college to get premium tot,0
tooo much ads it irritated me a lot but i have no other options that is why i have downloaded this app because other apps are worse than it so you can improve it i know your earning depends on it but since you can try to make us more addicted to this app no doubt this is app is good but not that much,0
im so addicted to spotify lmao premium is perfect for me for when my phone loses service i live in alaska and it happens lol i still keep all my downloaded music ty spotify d,1
worse music player ever i can not play any music that i want i only can play the entire playlist and unable to choose one fav song,0
latest update its really glitchy play bar is gone from time to time,0
spotify have always been my go-to music streaming platform but for awhile now does it consistently happen that the media control buttons doesnt appear in app or in notifications ive tried to clear the app cache and tried to reinstall the app but nothing seems to work,0
glitchy slow wont connect to devices,0
every next update is even worse time to load now is about 2 minutes,0
very good app but if there are no ads then it would be nice,1
keeps constantly shutting off or continuously playing and the buttons freeze for play pause and loses ff and rewinding options got a samsung s21 thats even the problems began fix the bug this used to be 5 stars,0
every update different problem podcasts start and stop randomly when app is open doesnt display info for scrolling skipping pausing etc wont play through android auto anymore as well castbox is a better podcast app spotify is good for music and rogan only,1
love the songs all my sort of music old and new and its free,1
the adsthere are always three ads in a row two ads are bad enough but who decided to put triple ads cancel them cancel them now       ,0
greatest experience in music play in my life ,1
since last update music randomly stops wont play stops when phone is locked despite permissions being set up correctly frequent force closes and at times will display and play different audio to what has been selected i am a premium member but will not continue if these issues continues,0
wont let me pause the music when i open the app,1
the app is fine i just hate when it plays another song thats not even in your playlist like sis no,0
good sound music any thing you want to listen to,1
amazing,1
best music streaming platform,1
spotify is a really good app to hear music if you like to  but they might not have all the songs you like,1
keeps changing what my storage is set to from my sd to my phones memory this is really annoying,0
used to work perfectly but now crashes a lot sometimes i can not even switch the music off and have to restart my phone,0
great app only problem is it is to big for me to keep on my phone would be good if it was possible to move app to sd card,0
i cant download music and offline mode works bad,0
i enjoyed how the music has been played and what i like i would come a member but i dont know how to hook up how to get paid keep listening keep up the good work,0
its a great app but there is a downside i can not get the song i want when i play it on my playlist it goes to a song that spotify added i hate all of the songs that they added and i want to play one simple song but whe i play them they are playlists with hiddious songs fix this,0
have been a premium member for years but since the last update i hate it the only way to pause or stop playing a song is to uninstall the app and then install it again the tool bar at the bottom has disappeared all i can do is play if i come out of the app its still playing please fix using spotify on android phone,0
the app is very easy to use and it sounds great my problem with it is that it keeps playing suggested songs in my all my playlists even though it has over 50 artists and songs in it,0
too many adds and you are very restricted in what you can listen to consecutively on freeplay,0
its bad the ads arent that bad but you should be able to turn the recommended songs off i want to listen to just the song in my playlist but it keeps playing the recommended songs and its annoying please make a way to turn it off,0
excellent n easy to access music,1
recently got this through my work ill be listening a long and out of nowhere it just stops playing i have to open my phone and then itll start playing again but a fews songs back i cant be doing that while im driving please fix this,0
spotify was good tell it started adding songs randomly to my playlists and the other thing if i have 15 songs i would like to only listen to those 15 songs not others that the app recommends if i went through the trouble to find 15 songs that i like i dont want to listen to any other ones but if i over look that yes its a good app but come on i dont want to listen to songs that arent on my playlists sorry for the rant but come on,1
this app was ok at first but my debit card was recently charged without my consent as i cancelled my account last year this is absolute fraud do not get spotify they take money out of your account illegally they even admitted that my account was cancelled and refused to return my money back unacceptable,0
too many ads not enough skips and the app crashes everyday fix your app and it is so dumb you have to pay for premium just to look at the songs on your playlist,0
one of the best music streaming app ,1
well the advertisement between songs sucks but still i love this app the most heheh thankuuuu,1
i love sports and song,1
instead of playing a playlist or a song the app will just play a random playlist or play random songs that have nothing to do with the playlist and arent even on it then ads will loop forever instead of playing once and getting back to the playlist completely unusable,0
some of my favorite songs cant be played waiting for higheree audio or higher bit,0
the best ever music app after google play store with great quality sound n other effects specially the premium plan is so worth it ,1
very enjoyable,1
i use this for all of my podcasts and media love this app i even use it for my music when wifi is available,0
very good app it must included more features but i didnt find all lofi songs i rate 5 because i love it veryyy lovely app,1
great app may you add download option,1
i think this a great app but there is a minor inconvenence when im listening to a song midway on a playlist it stops plays two ads and goes to another song it would be great if this didnt happen so often,0
keeps crashing and wont open stopped my phone from opening on multiple occasions,0
since yesterday the music keeps stopping randomly sometimes the music play controls disappear and i have to restart the app so i can bring it back please fix the app,0
been very glitchy recently its really annoying i just wanna listen to girl kn red and mitski is it just mine or,0
free music  spotify  full of ads ,0
its nice but there are ads come out of no where so  but no problem its very good app,1
app doesnt open from time to time how do you mess it up after an update please fix,0
pays poorly compared to other services also decides to mess up when theres no internet connection so thats fun after all this they increased prices in a sly way by only warning of your current subscription going up not others and now the app is going all wonky if youre increasing prices increase the quality not lower it tried moving songs to sd card had to force shut app then reinstall it,0
this app is used to be good until these certain problems started happening it sometimes pause music by itself and sometimes it dont play the next song on the playlist automatically meaning you have to stop what your doing to go to the next also sometimes when it pause by itself it restarts the whole song,0
i love how spotify is supporting free speech its the only reason i switched from pandora,0
when i want to listen to a soundtrack it mixes other soundtracks with it i just want to listen to the songs i want to,1
i have not subscribed to spotify premiumcz i dont want it but i think the tactic spotify is using to force people to buy premium subscription is by bullying them into it by progressively annoying ads after every other song atleast you used to provide 30 min continuous music before it ruins the whole experience especially since i have my exams and i used to play calming music so here you go im gonna uninstall it now this tactic is purely abhorrent,0
i really love app but the reason i give it a 4 is cause every time i listen in my laptop at the begining it always repeat,1
my downloaded files are constantly getting deleted for no reason,0
i love this app very very perfect work and best for music ,1
i really enjoy the product so healthy and encouraging,1
longtime user since the last update the app will frequently stop showing whats now playingthe bar at the bottom is missing i have to restart the app till it messes up again sometimes itll pause by itself as well spotify fix your app because im about to drop my premium sub,0
please change back the play button to where it was  the new design   is neither practical nor aesthetically pleasing,0
a lot of ads come in this after every two songs the add comes please remove the add,0
i love it because i can hear different music,1
spotify can pay rogan 100 million dollars but they cant spend 10k on this shotty app so many glitches and bugs and stop it cant switch what im listening too it says its still playing a podcast that i listened to 3 podcasts ago,0
poor app every 20 min ad roll continuesclear the bugs,0
wide selection of music but too many ads also the space it takes up is way higher than 28 mb it will randomly jump up to a gb or higher after a while,0
ive been using this app to listen to podcast for the last year it was great until recently about two minutes into playing itll glitch the now playing wont display whats actually being played so i cant pause if necessary among other issues,0
why are u thinking to download it or not  just download it it is an app for music lovers ,1
a brilliant app especially for self development podcasts,1
long time user but and pay for premium but keeps crashing in the middle of songs and continues to play after being force closed,0
a want a app that can download musicnot to just listen,1
wonderful i dont know what i did before spotify found so much new music,1
spotify has been around for a long time and know how to make a good music app everything is laid out simple finding songs and making playlists easy,1
full package when it comes to music,1
its a really good app to play musicpodcasts but i dont really like how much it changed and how more aggressive it is to non-premuim users non-premium users are beaten to the point where all they can do is only shuffle i didnt have premium for a day and i felt like i got pushed off a roof pc and console players that use spotify without premium arent as punished as non premium mobile players,0
play bar dissappears when i am playing music there has been a bunch of times now where the play bar has disappeared i have to close the app to get it to come back i have so had the app crash this needs to be fixed please thanks,0
i have purchased premium plan however i am getting low volume quality song,0
apk mod doesnt work anymore i guess ill pay to spotify again,0
i absolutely love spotify i have been with them for years and out of all the entertainment apps out there spotify by far is the best,1
al music apps dont represent the artist well enough but this is my choice,1
horrible customer service poor ethics and incompetent employees after 4 years of asking spotify to cancel my account they are still charging my card and ignoring my requests amazon music and and pandora is just so much better,0
my last review was about me not being able to use spotify because its offline my wifi is turned on and i have stable service i cleared my cache didnt work so i cleared my storage when i tried to log in it didnt work i know the password tried logging in on my laptop it worked i uninstalled the app i place my info so i can log it it says logging in it took so long so i sent myself an email i press it it takes sooooo long again but all it says link has expiredit wasnt even 4hrs,0
im bringing down my rating until we get cd quality music so many other services offer it now at the base price but not spotify,0
nice app buying premium soon ,1
i love this app    i can search all fmy favorite artists and my favorite songs with lyrics,1
this app has become a problem why do you always have to download all the songs over and over again after you did it for the first time buffers all the time will crush out of nowhere and all that on premium we dont get what we pay for,0
the best app music is everything and spotify makes it easy to get it,1
app sucks constantly kicks off junk,0
even without premium i can still enjoy my music its a very very nice and enjoyable app,1
great music outstanding service i use it when traveling and i keep my mind at peace,1
collection is good but genre of any song can be added in the information and selection panel so any user can play their favourite genre its just a suggestion,1
this app suck lately  it used to be good now total dissapointment wats the point of paying mthly subscription and getting a bad experience music keep stopping halfway app seems to freeze on its own unssubscribe done uninstalling doneanybody knows any other music app beside spotify,0
the new update sucks you cant play any song you want it was better before until the developers put play any song in premium  now you can only play music using shuffle mode please put the play any song back in free rather than on premium t  t,0
one of the best music streaming services out there the premium membership is definently worth the price for no ads and higher music quality spotify also has a discover weekly playlist that based on your listening preferences will find new music for you all in all spotify is an amazing app give it a shot,1
music keeps cutting and the play bar doesnt appear please uodate this and have it fixed,0
i dont have trouble with spotify normally but for some reason my playlists are disappearing and are not seen when i want to play a song it doesnt let me and other issues i believe it the device but i could be wrong,0
totally great but the problem is you cant use the app offline,0
ive been using spotify for quite a long time but lately whenever i play a playlist it doesnt play the songs that are suppose to be made by the artist it just plays other songs that arent even in the playlist i only want to listen to songs by my fav artist playlist but it keeps playing other songs,0
this application used to be good for a while now whenever i play podcasts on my samsung galaxy phone the audio will randomly stop after a few minutes of playing it also has weird bugs where it doesnt show ti be playing a song but the audio is coming through very disappointing how this app has fallen from being benchmarking in my opinion,0
come onguys you can try in with this application and you would be happy ,1
always a great service even with ads just makes it feel like a radio,1
i have an experienced a single add once not even a single advertisement and also all the song choices its beautiful ive never seen a better music app in my life this is better than youtube music,1
what the heck is going on with this app it was great and now it skips and when i open the app to turn off what im listening to the player at the bottom has disappeared and i cant turn it off without closing the app restarting the phone and the app only helps temporarily reinstalling the app only works temporarily i have loved spotify but am considering switching to amazon music because of this nonsense,0
i cant continue with google because i uninstalled the app with the other account i tried the same google account and it wont work i hate this alot fix this,0
everything good until recent update cant even play a thing,1
i would like a dislike button so i can tell the app not to place that song in my randomized lists again besides that this is the best music app,1
love it listen everyday in my ear buds at work you freaking rock,1
exceptional,1
2022 edit this feature has been added hooray would be nice if podcasts pause momentarily when notificationsdirections pop up while im driving,0
it has a lot of glitches and sometimes it just flat out doesnt work sometimes and the glitch that happens to me is it doesnt show the music bar for paused music other than that its easy to use and i just hope it gets fixed,0
there so much ads after every single songs,0
it is a very interesting app it allows me to find songs that are very old and also the latest ones i surely recommend this app to be used as a music player,1
been running really slow for about 2 weeks nowsaying know internet tooamazon music maybe the way ahead,0
truly amazing apphas become part of my day to d y life activities,1
great music listening experience would love an option to identify a song playing in the background,0
getting a constant bug where every time i go back into the app the music player wont showload unless i force stop and restart the app cant find a way to fix it,0
too many problems to list ill stick with yutubemusic,0
its just an awesome appit has everything i would want in an app keep up the good work,1
can only play a preview of my liked songs and its the same in any playlist i make and if i want to hear a full song then i can only press the shuffle button and hope,0
i like spotify very good collection oldnew varities songs varities singer,1
this app is way to buggy for how big the company is and how long its existed long load times buttons fail to do anything continually having to speak to tech support avoid,0
you cant play specific songs unless you pay you can get free alternatives so dont shill for some big corporation - there are better ways to support smaller artists,0
crashing since the last update audio will just stop playing some songs will keep playing but wont let you see the current selection,0
i cant pay for premium everytime i try to re new my details it loads the same exact page to me i spent an hour trying to fix this to no avail fix this i tried paying with go pay but couldnt at all,0
buggy stops all of the sudden cannot pause choose second or skip current song,0
i really appreciate it its so gooood i can sing because it have some lyrics ty thats it,1
excellent music options and ease of play list creation without commercials,1
it is a cool app,1
love you guys but why all the crashes fix coming soon please please please,0
i enjoy listening to spotify and the fact that i can put my music into into my own playlist also i can pick any kind of podcast i like and make my own podcast as well,1
without premium spotify is a pain to use honestly really bad im better of using youtube music and get ads every 4-5 songs than not be able to skip a song 6x a day ,0
only useful for background playcant choose what song you want to listen to without premium or replay a song,0
constantly skips and lags even on things i have downloaded,0
only problem ive encountered that actually bothers me is the cut down lyrics a lot of songs have missing words and that kinda sucks,0
ads are ridiculously overdone in the app ads play indiscriminately in many scenarios after every song switching to another station pausing and resuming a song rejecting a song etc it seems like there are 3-5 ads being played per song very poor experience ads should play once at maximum per hour deezer has been better in that respect so far atleast play different ads rather than all being about signing up for spotify premium,0
easy to navigate way tyriuggt the app,0
the scroller in the liked songs no longer works you cannot interact with it plus of you have a lot of songs you have to scroll with finger for a while before the scroller even shows on screen from behind the play button it is fine in any other playlist it seems,1
the app is amazing you get to listen to all kinds of music even tracks u didnt know,1
enjoy every bit of this app easy to use and great categories to choose from,1
some song are not available  so i want search in another app for the song it makes irretated us,0
as good as any other music app ive tried,1
whats wrong with spotify these days,0
hello spotify im experiencing something really bad in the app it was the best app for me until yesterday but now all out of sudden my playlists and songs have disappeared and im not able to search anything it says the app is unable to connect my samsung galaxy m30 device plzz look into the matter thank you,0
i would like to play the song in full also stop with so much abertizing and please let me play my own song for example i play xxxtenacion and put lii mosey please work on that,0
this is the best music app i have experience,1
most music when you want it,1
i dont like the 10000 songs limit on a playlist apple music is better at this because the playlists can be infinite or as many as your phonecomputer can hold,0
randomly doesnt allow me to control the podcast ive selected to play will not allow me to pause play or go forwardbackward very odd,0
used to love this app  then they started censoring an editing podcasts and shows that dont fit the agenda,0
working best utiliza last update on samsung s10 with oneui 40 i start playing music and then it stops also playback notification with music controls wont work and in-app music controls wont be shown,0
this is top when i down i can get the right muise i love it,1
great list of bands that isnt available on other services,1
horrible i cant find the buttons the songs wont show up even if i updated it what happened,0
i absolutely love spotify it takes me back to the music that i listened to the most back when i was younger,1
completely unusable app literally crashes when you attempt to launch it dont know why i pay for their service,0
stopped playing podcasts on every device except my phone months ago no clear fixes online this known issue is not fixed i pay for premium and it doesnt even work bs,0
app has only recently become stable prior to that it required a force stop and relaunch to resume anything i had playing the only reason i have remained is they are better than google and amazon music my advice for the devs do better or the second someone comes around with a half way decent product youll hemorrhage customers,0
i like this app very much but unfortunately i pressed the button that puts the song in the tv and i didnt want that to happen but now its all good so thanks for making this app awesome,1
app is a super and incridible app own playlists also super ad will be coming once whill playing song 10 to 15 seconds this app is useful and motivation for me,1
i do not like how the music stop suddenly,0
soy msico y musicoholica adicta a la msica y cada sonido se ha hecho parte de mi vida de alguna u otra forma en spotify he podido encontrar no slo esos sonidos nuevos que me impactan hoy sino aquellos con los que relaciono cada etapa de mi vida ya mis seres ms amados definitivamente recomiendo spotify,1
amazing if you have premium and if you cant afford you still have 3 months free,1
android version seems very buggy compared to ios very slow to load and start wont play downloaded music and generally disappointing,0
i love listening to music through here i just wish you didnt have to have premium to choose the songs you would like to listen too all i can do is hit shuffle play,0
this app is so desperate for money i get ads after every 2 songs i play ,0
with the new release the player control keeps disappearing which means you cant pause the tracks without exiting the app,0
what is up with this new version why am i now unable to stop my music without force stopping the appthe pause button no longer works i loved this app and am a premium memberbut am seriously thinking of ending my subscription,0
love the app its easy to use and i can play any genre i want i dont like the ads during my playlist though,1
ridiculous update dont pay for their premium until they bring back the now playing music bar both in app and in notifications where is the dislike button,0
great app listen all day while at work not using premium but still great app,1
siyabonga goodman sountsha,1
worst customer service ever spotify has gotten so big that they forgot us little people are the ones that put them in their ivory towers and golden thrones but they are like the stellar rockstars and huge movie stars they only need us little people is when its time to pocket our moneywhats wrong with this picture its a sad song,1
very good mood settingssatisfied and approved,1
love the app use the calculator functiion often i cant seem to get spotify to work though it just says install and takes me to the play store page for spotify,0
amazing and super easy to use,1
if i didnt have spotify id probably just make goat noises and try to become a mumble rapper it also has really great podcasts my favorite of all time was added and i definitely didnt just stop using youtube to listen to the misfits at work for most of my work shifts its a good ap,1
great app in general but if i am using the app in background on my phone samsung galaxy s8 or while my display is turned off it starts lagging after some seconds which is kinda anoying this has been the case for 6 or more month now ,0
oh mannnew version of this app is rudeeeeebring previous version please and cant sign in with mobile number,0
its an amazing app i love it i use it every day for listening to music my only problem is i cant find a way to turn on videos for the songs that have them it doesnt even give me the option to do so id really like some help trying to figure that out but other than that its an amazing app,1
it has been quite eventful it has an efficient algorithm,1
the music always skips on the web player and randomly just stops outputting audio the video player is horrendous apparently they wont let you post reviews here either if they mention censorship of podcasters on spotify this app makes me miss my cassette player from 20 years ago which was way more reliable,0
new update are so trash lmao only 6 skip per hour  this is music app or game  we use to listen why you dont let me chose a song that i want to listen ,0
opened this all first time in 3 years 5 ads back to back i suggest another app,0
i hate spotify its only good if u pay for the monthly subscriptions and without it u can do barely anything its a money makig terrible app,0
ads adsadsadsand more ads then when you think they stopped ad right there,0
great app for all music old and new with features that make it fun,1
latest update  problems songs skip 2-3 seconds couple of times per song cant see screen that shows the song playing restarted phone several times  reinstall but it fixes the problem only for a short time samsung s21 ultra please fix paying customer,0
still shows no internet connection available nearly every time but given some time it does work so not to bad,1
just got hosed with 6 or 7 ads then they played one song from the playlist i selected before changing the artist and playing 3 more ads all in less than 10 minutes worse than cable tv im glad i left that behind excited to leave spotify behind too,0
i love this app but theres ads after 3 song its like boom theres a ad,0
great music app,1
this app is excellent  i have listen everyday,1
since samsung has updated spotify is not working properly,0
great app its just when i click on a song it usually plays a random song,1
i enjoy the musicbut how to download the music,1
glitchy - seems for a few months now the app either crashes or ceases to function correctly have to restart it repeatedly,0
buggy and glitch filled with an algorithm thats great at suggesting music you wont like and to top it off they are implementing a fact checker like all these other trashy tech companies leave my podcasts and music alone and let me decide who i want to listen to i dont need you trying to dissuade me from listening to joe rogan because he had a guest on that 4 whiny people dont like,0
great app price can be a bit more competitive compared to apple music,0
i like this app it have all types of songs like partylofipopsoft types of songs so i like this app i have give star and i also like the sound quality that is cool ,1
i get to find almost all music i love and can listen to my playlist offline,1
1  star fortis because premium adds,1
i love spotify so easy to find music and listen to great music whenever wherever,1
just to be clear i downloaded this app for the jre podcast only imagine we are all sitting in a giant stadium enclosed pitch black dead silent out of no where comes the jre podcast like a match flame in this darkness everyone one of us can see it some choose not to or deceive others that joe rogans light is false truth is light soon it will affect everyone personally enough to be able to see it differently and the light that has been there appears to them illuminate the darkness,0
great playlists  lots of options for the mood ,1
worst app i have ever seeneven if there is full speed internet connection app is not seem to play songshad downloaded 4-5 times but songs are not playingvery much disappointed with this appthere is not option of 0 star otherwise i would rate this app a big 0,0
idk whats going on but i like this song called gverment hooker sped up  and whenever i try to play it it either says song is not available  or it just skips to the next song on my playlist fix this please,0
would be better but theyre obsessed with shuffle and they dont let you reset progress on podcasts easily,0
this app is awesome but the ads every now and then take a while but other than that the app is amazing great sound,1
fed with adds they come like 3 or 4 times in a row,0
i used to love this app perfectly i understand the 30 day free trial without ads and i understand that there need to be ads but now that my trial ended it also plays other music of what im not looking for i have this rain playlist i go to sleep to but now it plays other music that i can not fall alseep to please have a option to play suggested music during our playlists thank you,0
it suddenly just stopped my plalist from playing properlythe right order also it is now different then it was yesterday and not in a good way i cant change the order of my playlist and it keeps glitching and only playing like a fraction of the song it might be because it wants me to go an dbuy premium or it wanted me to write this review this app is quite fiddly but you can still listen to songs easily if thats what your looking for,0
its shows lag while operating the app and the lag is severei though of buying the premium but i changed my mindof you make a solution for this maybe i can buy premium other than that the app is goodthats why i am giving 4 stars,1
cannot update my premium it always try to connect evn tho there is nothing wrong with the network,1
glitching a lot music cuts in and out when the screen turns offlocks,0
everytime an ad comes on it dosent make me want to get premium it almost always makes me want to delete my account,0
its very nice but frequently hard to find an exact song even when the list says that is the song you are choosing improvement please,0
wonderful experience i enjoy listening to the classic the app is a good one,1
since latest update songs in any playlistqueues will not auto play song selected plays then when sing ends nothing also green colored indication which song is playing though the song is playing ive cleared the cache uninstalledre-installed app fix your bugs or im canceling my premium subscription,0
so many bugs recently pausing music for no reason no play button music just stopping not worth paying for to be honest really hope they fix this soon,0
came here exclusively for joe rogan the joe rogan experience to be accurate joe is great spotify has a decent music selection also interface is 455,1
this app is great would be perfect if every time i cut my truck off it wouldnt start just playing on my phone but other than that its great,1
the app loses your spot when listening to podcasts they are not willing to cancel a crazy persons podcast joe rogan who has gone crazy since covid hit i will stand with neil young,0
an excellent song app which has the song that you are thinking of extremely user-friendly and super collection of songs from several genres spotify youve got it spot on ,1
pretty bad used it forever because its the only option but an overall bad app constantly stops playing for no reason uodate now the app just doesnt allow me to pause about 50 of the time and the control bar is almost always just gone man this app is so bad,0
i like that you can create your own playlists on the free version,1
since connecting to spotify i have found the program and the choice of music to be excellent i would certainly like to move to premium but unfortunately being an age pensioner makes it rather difficult perhaps spotify could consider a discount for age pensioners similar to that of the student discount only a suggestion once again thanks again for providing an excellent source of entertainment,0
the apps doing really good on my end although when i exit and play a song when i get back on the song doesnt show on the bottom i wish we could pin more than 4 playlists on my library other than that i still love spotify3,1
so now this app disappeared from my phone and wont install,0
is this what i get for a paid premium service a buggy as hell app latest is the player just disappears so theres no control or playing randomly starts in background how can a company the size of spotify just not just get it to work right,0
after listening to some hi-fi streaming services i will be canceling spotify premium soon the sound quality is night and day i almost feel cheated i didnt know about hi-fi get it together spotify and i might be backwell see,0
i had a very good experience until now but spotify robbed my money when i paid for the premium subscription and i didnt get the premium account activated after the successful payment and i still havent received my refund back all they say is that they didnt receive the payment which was successfully from my side dont subscribe for premium with upi they will rob you,0
i love spotify premium is the best however i have downloaded playlists that dont keep all the songs in said playlist downloaded every time i get a connection of some sort everything is downloaded again it makes no sense anybody understanding what im saying,0
best app for podcast and listening songs but gives many ads tho,0
for whatever reason i cant scroll to see the different genresmoods for my liked songs,0
this app is great but its really annoying with the 30 minutes of no adds to having close to 30 minutes worth of adds,0
horrible i cant access playlists or get to skip a song i dont like if u had skipped it 6 times in that hour do u know how annoying that is do not get this unless you want to spend money to get more than 6 skips and be able to listen to songs without having to listen to the previews only i clicked on a song and then another song came on and its really frustrating please fix this,0
good app cheap but good subscription ,1
tons of errors doesnt even display the song playing older version was like awesome,0
if only the premium version is free i would be using spotify 247 but overall it is ok,1
best collection of music,1
app continues playing a title but the app will not display the track or playpauseshufflerepeat features fix this soon or lose my premium membership,0
its always been a great streaming service ive let my subscription cancel for years and come back to my same massive library fully intact,1
new to spotify so far so good,1
i just paid for a mini premium 3 times and it shows that the money has been cut of from my account but the mini premium choice isnt appearing on my spotify account i want the money back if the mini premium wont be used in my account,0
love spotify and the student discount for premium,1
the only thing i dont like is i cant pick the song i want to play and i cant change from shuffle play to just playing from the first song to the last,0
way too many adds,0
new update has made me unable to connect to spotify on my pioneer car stereo please fix this,0
i love this spotify because it gives us opportunity to lition songs for free,1
i loved this app i enjoy listening music,1
i pay for premium and its amazing i use spotify every day and its worth every penny,1
easy to select tunes especially for a technophobe,1
i really enjoy spotify its user friendly and you can create your own playlist the only issue i have with the app is when i play music on shuffle it replays the same songs instead of having more variety,0
always great  been with them from the start,1
keeps saying no internet when set to offline when stuff im trying to play is downloaded stuff turn to online with my wi fi same gd thing worked great for years now this why do i pay for premium,0
spotify is amazing music platform,1
often i will add songs to my queue and then they just disappear like what its so frustrating,0
excellent collection and excellent voice quality,1
too many advertisements,0
lovely interface and wonderful app overall,1
premium is worth buying spotify - music soinds better with you ,1
my drop down menu is completely frozen at the top app crashes on a daily cant fix literally had to uninstall and install back download all my songs backhe of a lot and problem still wasnt fixed i am using the latest version of spotify as well as the latest version of android spotify used to be great but as of recent it seems they cant keep up with android updates as there are bugs all over the app seriously considering leaving premium,0
i need lyrics but all songs dont have lyrics,0
when used at first the app was all good but as soon as i kept using it and paly songs or make a liked list it keeps playing adds for premium back to back unless you finally get irritated and close the app  spotify neens to know that keep showing adds back to back 1st 2nd and 3rd 4th time wont attract its customers rater will make them feel irritated we open the app for songs not for the adds ,0
its working nice,1
very good app for listening music full mood refreshment,1
pretty,1
keeps crashing and not showing the bar to pause skip whatever but still playing the music and keeps signing me out im boutta stop payin for this app,0
spotify is so cool,1
it use to be goodlets just say its not anymoreit doesnt let me acess it i tried re installing it but it still doesnt workand whats with all these ads there meant to be every 30 minbut for me its almost 7 in 10 min,0
periodically starts playing music and not allowing me to see whats playing or change the song,0
its a good app and ive been using it for a year now but it has been extremely glitchy what happens is that if i play a song from my playlist a random song just stays playing and i cant seem to turn it off,0
i am not a big fan of any advertising other than that i really enjoy the variety of artist and listening to my favorite songs of my past and present artists i was gifted an aqurboost boom speaker for xmas which i use to accompany spotify this 5 star app thank you and bless you,1
too many bugs and glitches if you force me to use your app by monopolizing my favorite podcasts than at least have your app work correctly,0
kind of late but thank you for making it available in my countryso far so good other than the annoying adds tho theyre kinda rare but if i wasnt broke id pay 4 premium ,1
i love music and enjoy spotify and being able to make my own playlists,1
an app that cant play a song we like for free at the time we want is useless,0
fix the bugs put all songs back and allow us to pause downloads dude these are simple things that every music streaming platform should have stop slacking also my downloads keep getting deleted edit 2022 same issues bro,0
great,1
great app and really enjoy the music and building special playlists to enjoy but word of advice for spotify owners stay neutral from politics these are ugly times folks just want to listen to music or podcasts if they dont like what they hear they simply can turn the channel to something they do like do not cave to a small percentage of those who think their policies and opinion should be the opinion of the whole freedom is what endures forever that and keeping the price low too ,0
its alright but not having the option to listen to a album in order an less you pay for premium kinda sucks,0
im very happy with my service love all the different options and artist and song suggestions,1
its hella good can play in the background has no bugs i use it like 24 7,1
good app after all but its not playing suggested songs instead of the songs we want to listen to is annoying i wont waste my money on premium for playing my own songs because i want to have money and not be broke you guys are just trying to make money like that so we can stop complaining nice try wont get my money i wont ever trust premium plus not everyone has money to afford premium whether its expensive it cheap for them so what will they do nothing,0
love everything about spotify,1
great service but the last update caused weird bugs on my device,0
too much of ads song by ad song by ad   how to i lesion the songs,0
this app is amazing and has all the best songs,1
honestly ive been using this app for a long time but now ive gone through all the ads multiple times the hundreds of ads every two songs theres more ads than music at this point,0
i love the app especially after i got premium in my opinion the premium is a really good choice especially if you dont like ads and you like to skip a lot of songs,1
the app is recommending me to add songs that i already have in my playlist that never happened before its a useful tool to discover new songs based on my playlist but now is useless it dont even recognize that the song is already added if i press the  button,0
it has become the most useless no song has been playing for some days,0
hi to all of,1
spotify is one of the most amazing applications for me all songs are available in the app and i loved it,1
it keeps telling me that im offline while my network is so good and working very well with other apps,1
still extremely slow when changing storage to external sd card im convinced this is done on purpose spotify knows of this issue and has done nothing to solve it over time i have changed sd cards each being faster in read write speedsall samsung brand and please add dont like song so it will never appear again in my searches or playlists,0
its a super app for listening music its wonderfull i love this app,1
so many bugs always crashing premium isnt worth it anymore,0
this is amazing for someone like me who likes to listen to songs always ,1
its always been glitch and laggy even with strong connection and now the lyrics wont load,0
wow this app is amazing i gives all kinds of music from your favourite artists ,1
customer support is slow i cant reset my password i tried to create an account and it says emails exists i try to reset it says emails dont exist so which is it ,0
best app for music ,1
the app is amazingsince i have paid premium i love the recommendationslike it figures exactly what u want,1
an amazing app for music lovers i tell u to try it i has stories songspoems everything,1
its a good app but there are few things bad with it it has a 6 hour wait to it when u skip like 4 or 3 songs 2 it skips randomly for no reason 3 u can pick ur own song u just have to hope its the first one here is a good thing u can actually change the song without it being random in daily mixes,0
the best music streaming app if you have premium,1
just wish it would let u download and keep music after the subscrition is done,0
this is getting absolutely ridiculous 6 ads all at once this shouldnt be like a tv commercial break i think spotify needs to get their act together just because some folk dont pay for subscriptions they shouldnt have to put up with several ads all the once every several minutes when i first got spotify it was 1 ad every 30 minutes now it got out of control disappointed,0
im taking back my bad review guys amazingu guys added lyrics to everythingnow its the perfect and most lovable app im usingno words love spotify,1
too many adsafter every song an adds start playing its very annoying and their it is said that after this as you can enjoy 30 minutes uninterrupted music but its not true,0
every every song i look for is there still havent found a song that isnt on there,0
when is the bug for changing and stopping a song going to be fixed im paying for premium to use a st app why its been like this for weeks now sort your app out,0
lovely enjoying music and very clear,1
this is absolutely horrible ill just stick to youtube everything was going fine until an update i cant even play the songs that i want my playlist no longer feels like mine i cant play the songs that i want and i cant even skip them whats worst is the ads are so long the app was perfect until everything suddenly changed i am deleting this ill stick to youtube,0
has all my music selection always on in my car or on my alexa some glitches where the play and next button dissappear also cant use it on my galaxy watch which is disappointing as it never connects,0
i do not like this app now why because when it updated they made it so you dont chose your own song to play and you dont get skip your song spotify change it back now,0
its a very very good application for listening songs podcasts etc i enjoyed very much with it this is a special music listening application because it give us the freedom to make our own privet or public playlist its amazing,1
awesome it has every song you want,1
its the best music app whatsoever those who say that it has constant adds face the truth you need to buy premium or else buy yourself a microphone and sing the song yourself,1
i recommend spotify over anyother music and audio app has everything i need,1
best music app out there only complaint is they dont have every single song on there but thats just me being super picky,0
i realy love listening spotify its convinient for me  everytime that i want to play my fav music  its easy to find the song,1
very buggy since last update - play bar dissapears cant pause or skip songs until i restart the app - the app deletes my dowloads randomly and i end up with no music when offline - when offline the app takes minutes to load my downloaded podcasts  this is a new almost empty memory s10 a restart will somwtimes fix the issue seriously thinking switching to another setvice yt,0
but we want the music we have downloaded go into our internal storage,0
spotify was doing so great until the latest update i have been having regular issues with playing music from where i left off because there is no option to play i have to close the app and open it again often more than once just to be able to press play or skip songs this needs to be fixed asap,0
its a good app to listen to music on and find out what peoples taste are and stuff like that,1
loved the app and service until the latest update frequent bluetooth glitches the current song playing appears sometimes used to be always have to restart the app to get things corrected - multiple times an hour hope it gets fixed quickly,0
works okay at the moment but theres a slight issue where the genre slider at the top of the liked songs list cannot slide ,0
ive been in my spotify for almost 6 years now i like ever since the day i started listening to it ive got all the songs i looked and want to hear and its a great app ,1
1 star if you dont pay for spotify premium but 5 stars if you do i really reccomend premium as it unlocks loads of more options 100 percent worth the money for premium also you can get family plans as well as premium duo which is just a version fof the family plan but just 2 people,1
very nice app for songs,1
the free version is horrible you can only skip 6 songs until 1 hour really its so stupid like i just want to listen to music freely i dont mind adds here and then but please make at least 10 song skips 6 is to low way to low can you ple3eeeaaaassee add her last words- by courtney parker pleeeeeeeeeeaaa aaaaasssseeeeee,0
portrait mode on the samsung galaxy s8 doesnt show right the play shuffle and other buttons are showing ontop of each other please fix,0
unfortunatelly spotify can not delivery the basics if you use spptify for more than a couple days the playing now pannel simply disappear and you bo longer have control of the music playing the problem is so sevre that sometimes forcely stopping spotofy is not enough for stop music from playing and you need to turn off your phone,0
kind of glitchy and the recommned for you songs are just half of the songs you are have liked but solid app,1
i find this app super i use it to listen to podcasts more than musicbut also for music sometimes,0
since my last review of spotify the app has improved a lot and i like it now,1
untill last update it was awesome but new update is too bad they made it complex for the sake of design its too difficult to navigate between songs while searching,0
tf spotify why i cant listen to my fav music why do i have to buy premium so i can the shuffle like bruh i love spotify before but now i hate it so much u guys really want money huh this is why alot of people are quitting spotify and download other free music on free no premium im so disappointed 1 star for this,0
most recent listened to stuff right at the top as you open the app so you can just jump straight it simple and brilliant,1
i use spotify daily there are a few problems when creating a new playlist if it isnt over 40 or so minutes long it wont stop suggesting songs or playing random songs im on the free version and the ads played between songs while bearable are quite ridiculous sometimes the songs just stop halfway through and start over when played again spotify is probably the best music app ive seen though so i wont be leaving but i do hope that these problems are taken care of,0
too much ads sometimes feel like to deleating it,0
the songs are good enriching soothing and comforting,1
i absolutely love spotify,1
app is practically unusable after any update also now you get ads with premium anyway i would respectfully like to let spotify know they should just just shove this app where the light doesnt touch instead of actively making their user experience worse,0
legit too many ads also they keep deleting my reviews soundcloud is better at this point,0
too many ads,0
i am very happy with spotify it works flawlessly,1
overall is decent app has the capability of downloading podcasts and songs for offline listening but the downloads section wont appear if offline what is the point of downloading a podcast if im unable to access it outside of internet access,0
well 2 or 3 years ago i thought it sucked until they started creating playlists for you that are actually extremely accurate on your music taste  if you dont find what you want to hear on spotify youll end up having a new favorite genre audio quality settings are outstanding and give you a great musical experience,1
have paid app  it keeps stopping my wifi signal is very good and this keeps happening all the time please fix this problem ,0
favorite app to listen to music on but i hate the new update when i am adding songs to my playlist to see if i would like them id prefer to listen to them first on spotify rather than searching them up on youtube if you could make it to where you can listen to a short section of the song again that would be much appreciated,0
not a very good app unless you can pay for a monthly subscription,0
cant play it with netgear orbit,0
why am i getting ads when all its playing is suggested songsthen 3 ads 2 30 seconds and a 10 second one im currently listening to my liked songs and ive been listening for nearly an hour and have only heard the song that wasnt finished playing from last time and one afterthe rest has been suggested songs,0
i loved this until all of a sudden it changed the way i view my playlists and other songs and stops randomly even tho ive changed all my settings to accommodate it,0
it helps a lot it doesnt give you adds that much and you can turn your screen off and listen to music at the same time unlike youtube or any other rip off app spotify is the best app ever and i recommend it,1
great playlist excellent app,1
i like spotify but the thing that gets me is the adds there are to many and that are really long most of the time i feel like i listion to more adds than i do music but i like that i dont have to get premium to be able to turn off my phone and still listion to music but the adds,1
most reliable streaming app which brings my favorite songs,1
the best it is not bad i love it because it lets you make your own playlist and it lets you put what whatever songs you want on a certant playlist,1
this app is very good  i can listen to all my favorite songs ,1
i really would love it if they fixed the issue with watching podcast on all devices so strange that certain devices such as smart tv and ps4 and roku you cant get video only audio so frustrating,0
the issues i have are with its compatibility with google assistant half of the time when requested to play something it plays a completely unrelated song for example for a while when asked to play kelly clarkson it would actually play kelly carson a largely unheard of cover singer its quite frustrating when all you want is hands free compatibility,0
its pathetic has so many bugs have to restart the phone to use it properly,0
i have been a premium user of spotify for more than a year due to the best experience ive had i recommend this app thank you for the best service spotify,1
last update was trash please fix it,0
spotify is my favourite music streaming app using a spotify duo plan it gives you great interface no ads nothing in between you and your music,1
best app ever it consumes less data and good for study and workout playlist,0
i cant choose the songs i want to listen to,0
beautiful app wouldnt use any other streaming platform but spotify only wish yall had japanese songs available,0
the best streaming service these days  but i have to give away one star because it cant swipe down from now-playing page to go back home,0
getting more glitchy integration with heos is horrible and unstable please fix,0
would rate it better if you returned the ability to preview the songs before you add them to your playlist seriously what idiot decided it was a good idea to remove that feature also the ads yes i get it you need money and stuff but do you really need to give 2 30 second ads every song also the fact you search up a specific song and its put in as a playlist whats the point of that other than that its a good app just has some problems,0
love to stream podcasts and wide variety of music,1
i have enjoyed everything spotify offers,1
love it the music is great and no politics buck owens to the ramones love it,1
updates with spotify are dangerous find a working version and dont update now the clip art doesnt work right in all liked songs and when i go into an artist and then my liked songs within that artist and hit shuffle i now get random unrelated artists instead of shuffling the liked songs within that artist which is how it has always worked in the past this is a failure of leadership please do not blame the lowest employeesdevelopers those who higher the failing managers need to be replaced,0
one of the best apps ever i have tried its very amazing just that the primium prices are pretty high and would like to wish it lows down and will hope to buy someday very good app for sure,1
stuff wont playor start and stop constantly,0
spotify free for mobile literally sucks i refuse to fork over money that doesnt go to hard working artists,0
unable to play the audio i downloaded while flight mode or offline,0
great app for music but missing so many tracks from so many artists and gives preference to ios devices for updates and features appreciate if swipe to queue feature is rolled out soon enough as the ios users have been enjoying this feature since years,0
nice app because of listening music all the time ,1
well this is my first time to download but the reason why i download a spotify apps because i wanna listen with jungkook songs this is so good ,1
definitely worth 5 stars i have over 350 songs stored on my phone but eversince i discovered spotify i dont even listen to my own music anymore the playlists that are created contains all the music i love,0
the we added feature thing is useless every single time you make a playlist with one song they just add more so you get less bored or stuff idk bruh this app is good but i wouldnt recommend making your own playlist,0
excellent app for music lovers,1
app wont connect to the spotify in my vehicles radio now it worked just fine a couple of weeks ago then all the sudden wont anymore the phone connects but spotify does not it plays though bluetooth but not the spotify app has to be a update caused it i have a pioneer avh-2500nex head unit,0
its not working unresponsive,0
mostly good ad spam is a little to harsh,0
i would give spotify a 5 star rating but out of the blue it started cutting in and out inside my house and out in the yard spotify works great in my vehicles i dont get it it makes crushing beers outside less enjoyable when you have spoty music,1
the app is showing offline even when im connected to wifi the internet is working fine,0
latest android update is shocking - play controls both in-app and lock screen have disappeared and just stops playing every few songs,0
spotify is by far the best music streaming app i have ever used from the simplicity and easy to use ui to a whole array of all the music you need tailored to fit you perfectly the algorithms suggestions for new music are splendid and bring you closer to new music all in all 910 app 9 coz i am certain there is a lot more to come as they work up to 10,1
lots of great content to keep you busy,1
love the compilation of music that the app prepared,1
lots of bugs in the latest version,0
i get to hear what i want to hear when i want to hear it without no commercials youre freaking awesome keep up the great work,1
good song,1
latest update app starts playing music through phone when its disconnected from bluetooth,0
the choice to make it so only rich people who have premium be able to choose to play songs they want and forcing people who dont have premium just to shuffle till you get the correct song like if the ads werent enough,0
the experience is great i love all the songs and the playlist that i can make can be ove 27 hours,1
my mum and me was listening to music the entire night it was so funny  but the app is so good 4 stars,1
very relaxing and reliable really love the options of other songs u get at the bottom of making ur playlist ,1
an awesome user friendly app keep up the good work,1
works great i use it everyday enjoying the new feature of audiobooks would give 5 stars if it didnt feel like the same songs were played even with shuffle mode on,1
updating spotify is risky with the last few iterations podcast downloads take forever because they keep restarting from 0,0
look id give it a 5 star if it stopped adding random music to my playlistall im trying to do is listen to my playlist and some random bad songs i very much dislike appear and i cant relax and on top of thati skip the songs using my skips that i didnt know were limited and doesnt let me skip the worst most annoying songs i have never liked or ever will like because it doesnt say i have limited skips in a big tex box covering my whole screen as a warningi find my music infuriatingnot relaxing,0
idk whats going on but lately the songs are skipping like an old cd or something its annoying af,0
too many interruptions while listening to the music,0
i just want the lyrics i have downloaded the song and it display lyrics beneath the title yet no way even after clear cache uninstall reinstall i can use the lyrics feature please help and i will give 5 stars,0
great a wonderful discovery,1
horrible ad placing like theres literally 5 ads for every song and theyre not short 5 second ads no theyre long as 30 second ads thats a whole song worth of ads for every single song like im not here for ads,0
amazing - i can honestly say that spotify has changed my life for the better and is well worth the price of a subscription,1
updating review the latest update has changed spotify from one of the most reliable apps on my device pixel 4a 5g to one of the least consistent in about 8 years ive never had any issues with the service or app which i see as one of my most trusted unfortunately the current build suffers frequent playback issues  audio issues buffering and stuttering prioritising video over audio let me disable videos the device wifi broadcasting frequently fails all most recent reviews agree,0
wow this is a terrible app it doesnt even have the capability of playing for more than a fraction of a second without pausing the interface is horrible too i was actually looking for an alternative to apple music but this certainly isnt it luckily i tried the free version rather than paying a subscription pointless even trying to listen to anything uninstalled,0
fast and easy with many options i use it for podcasts and its never ending material,0
it is alright its just when you try to play a specific song and it makes you shuffle because i could just go to soundcloud and the problem is fixed,0
super,1
for ages spotify worked brilliantly synced well with home speakers and in-car stereo but recently when getting out of the car it continues to play on my phone but neither the app itself or the notification box displays a pause option the only way to turn off the musicpodcast is to completely turn offrestart my phone not exactly convenient,0
on june 14th 2022 i went into spotify to listen to my daily music and then apparently i saw you guys did some changes but i had a difficulty with those changes whenever i try to type in a song and press the song it will show me some playlist of some songs and when i go into my playlit it will show me some sings but i cant play it so please spotify please change back your app into its normal way before the changes you guys make because it will lead you guys into 0 reviews bc of this thank you,0
the app is good but the problem is the ads,0
its a great app but there starting to use to many adds,1
being part of spotify family is one of the most beautiful things that happened to me 21,1
vere cofartable and very clear sound i like very much,1
thanks spotify keep it up best app,1
best free music app out there it even stands in the top 3 of the ones that charge a fee for the complainers if you think you can get better for free your wrong and you cant get better when you pay for one either even the most expensive ones have the same little issues because certain issues cant be fixed perfect signal and perfect play comes with perfect reception and its where you live that determines that if you want better move to better reception areas theyre all the same,1
one of the best music streaming services out there for the price,1
love this platform tailors to my specific taste as well as music and podcasts from artists i enjoy,1
the best app for music we all love it and my dream is to also make an app like yours i am also a programmer,1
its my favourite app but i have premium so there are no ads im not sure how its like for other people but in my opinion best app ever 1010,1
cant even find music you are paying to listen to app wont let you access your account to cancel better off on youtube mobile browser with the screen blocker,0
i never listened to music much but i listen to it through spotify several hours a day,1
it does not play the music in the play list its pointles it plays other music insted of the one i pic,0
good app local file thing is a bit weird to use since sometimes it doesnt save the files but it works for the most part,1
i downloaded spotify for music not podcasts disappointed that im losing favourite artists because of joe rogans bs time to try out tidal,0
should also include downloading so that we could use it offlinefree of cost,0
unimpressed where is the bar that shows me what is playing where can i select a song i want to hear from my playlist how do i turn off the random selection on my playlist i hate this app,0
what the hell is this new update its abosulty awful the ui is confusing i cannot even listen to a specific song,0
bug that makes the app unusable at times it will say there is no internet connection when my phone has full bars and other apps work just fine have uninstalled multiple times android version 11,0
the first week the app was fine lack some feature like comments or support in finding song after that the ads just get worse and worse a lot of the time i press play the app just take me to some random song that i dont care about,0
great music are here mellow glorious songs is my favorite,1
i love a lot of things about spotify but there are some serious issues with this app that arent easy to fix my biggest issue is it randomly starts playing a sleep play list any time between 1am and 3am it does this if im sound asleep or listening to other songs also incredibly annoying is that it says enjoy the next 30 minutes as free plays one song and an ad comes on i dont understand why we cant listen to an album in order or a specific song we pay by listening to the ads,0
hate that podcasts have ads when im already paying premium to avoid ads,0
its nice but have more albums especially hip hop under new releases please,1
i dont really like it i love how it has my songs but i always have to shuffle and it wouldnt play my favorite songs anymore i think soundcloud is better,0
theres too many ads granted im not paying for premium,0
with the latest update i have to restart app so i can pause or skip music currently being played this option dissappears for some odd reason please fix,0
i will not say much but this is best app for listening music go ahead and download it,1
the best music application yet,1
i personally use spotify as my first choice music player and its good but sometimes it doesnt show to album cover for albums that i have downloaded even with a working internet connection,0
this is the 2nd time i am experiencing a technical glitch while opening this app the app is not getting opened as usually when it happened for the first time i uninstalled itwhen i reinstalled it worked fine but within a week i am facing a similar issue i hope this issue is addressed,0
thanks for getting rid of the smaller widget now i have to have a whole home screen dedicated to the biggest widget thanks for nothing,1
what bothers everyone is that 10 seconds enjoy the next 30 mins,0
i paid for premium buh i cant access it kindly fix the issue,0
its a great place for a podcast music and business spotify give you a spot to be yourself youll able to choose variety selection of entertainment that you may like to listen to even watch on scale 1-10 give company 9 i believe that its fair and honest business keep doing the right things and growing and growing congrats,1
i love the music it has rapjass damn even amine music keep up the good work,1
just amazing the fact that even if youve got smal data the app will work correctly i always like to stream music on this app before you start to rent it they gives anyone free listening for about a month so that after you can start to rent it very fantastic,1
far to many ads itll play two songs and than give me two minute worth of ads,0
i loved spotify enough to let go of saavn and gaana now i am back to wynk gaana and will explore saavn too there are two ads after every two songs let us not even discuss the features wherein we cant scroll back or ahead not able to shuffle the way i want and i dont know what all spotify is trying to be the pesky little neighbourhood child that you wont give your candy to,1
this is by far my fav app but lately its been cracking and even though i have premium the songs downloaded stopped playing from time to time and having my own data it states that theres no internet available when theyre already downloaded  i truly love this app but im getting tired of these issues,0
my most used app it is fantastic and i cannot get through even a single day without it ,1
service is outstanding recommendations are innovative and incomparable to other media outlets i got an idea  interface should include plug-ins to other internet radio softwares let internet radio stations use your medium to play music for their audience with proper licensing of course  win win for everyone involved you owe me for this idea c,1
spotify is massive i get every song i need local and international,1
had spotify for years and has worked amazingly up until a year ago now its constantly crashing pausing randomly takes ages to load up and mixes all my playlists up,0
good,1
the spotify app isnt what it used to be wont play songs i want but other random songs i dealt with commercials because its free but to not play the songs i want when i press play well,0
group session on the same device not working anymore going back in time worst audio quality compared to other streaming audio services,0
as  jan 2022 full 5 stars really good platform for a tech dinosaur like me just upgraded download settings and sound quality is better watch mobile data usage though grown to love it only reason not 5 stars is that periodically i have to reinstall to make work in the background on my phone otherwise its really good update feb 21 gone back to a galaxy s from am a much better now given 5 stars as much more stable,1
the android version of this app is a nightmare it doesnt let me listen to the song i want instead shuffling no matter what i do the ios and windows versions of the app never gave my any trouble,0
have had to cancel due to all the problems mentioned in other reviews such a pity as when it works its a great subscription but unfortunately it hasnt worked properly for the last few mths constantly having to restart my phone to get it to work and even then it only worked for a short time i have tried everything suggested by spotify and nothing was resolved and after seeing other reviews its clearly not an isolated issue off to try amazon music,0
its really so good and best app specially for musics and songs ,1
daily drive needs to change around liked songs to other liked songs dont want to start unliking my favourite songs but might have to if daily drive keeps repeating them every session every day hey otherwise daily drive is great likewise the app reading some of the reviews indicates paying although expensive does appear to be worth it to avoid issues the free app users experience,0
honestly it used to be a good app and itd do what it should as a music player or a platform but now its trash keeps crashing for absolutely no reason keeps saying im not connected to the internet while i am otherwise how would i be posting this rn and it totally sucks now guess 2022 wasnt your year spotify,0
i hate the new update i cant even listen to music i want when i clicked play it always play ramdom song what a dumb update,0
cant play any songs it always says youre offline even when i have high speed wifi and network it is become a worst music app available in play store,0
nice i hav fav songs k pop songs like bts black pink exo txt and etc  but ads are a bit disturbing,0
great app good music experience the app has few local songs though,1
i started having issues when going through my playlists when i scroll through it keeps crashing ive uninstalled and reinstalled the app but that didnt fix it ive also restarted my phone im not sure what else to do edit latest update did not solve this it has only made it worse the app freezes a lot and the crashing has become more frequent,0
id rate this app 5 stars if the did take away the fact that i cant pick song from my like list anymore i hate have to forcefully have to listen to bts to able to listen to something else this is torture,0
not just brilliant for music but excellent for podcasts too,1
very good just wish their were less without having to pay,1
i played listened to 10 songs without any interruption of ads just wanted to check on yall you guys ok also i havent bought premium regardless of the passive aggressive ads,0
absolutely amazing i got family plan and my whole family loves to listen their favorite music from spotify audio quality is superb and very easy to use edit i cant open notifications anymore it just says try again and its very annoying i have spotify premium individual,0
i love spotify i have been listening to all my favourite songs on this application but there have been a problem as soon as iam trying to play a song the application is shutting down by itself please fix this problem,0
i hate that when i drive the music just cuts out then i have to open my phone to play the music repeatedly,0
downloaded the app but it is not opening,0
good,1
mine keeps stating no internet connection very annoying as id have to reset my phone everytime i want to stream music,0
i dont really want to pay to get premium ,0
awesome will never go back to iheartradio or pandora spotify is the way my brother lol,0
my playlist messed up idk what to do i cant play a single song,0
deleting this app bcz i dont listen to songs what i listen are advertisements and not 1 or 2 its 5 at a time i gave it 5 star as a gift and switching spotify to gaana atleast they made me hear songs,0
amazing application i loved itthis is very soft and simple to use and listen the songi never seen application like this before and i love it thank you spotify for making my days better,1
so fine top version of the best of luck with your own home and garden inn at the end of this tag only shows image of the best of all time  it is a great day of school and college and the other side of my own personal injury or death and baggage claims to have a great deal of time and money to buy a new phone and email address to receive this is my word predictor talking and is the future of uncategorized communicationtap on a clip to paste it in the text box,0
ive had premium for years but ill be cancelling my subscription the constant podcasts playlists and artists that i couldnt care less about being shoved in my face are beyond irritating if spotify improves its mobile ui and removes the irrelevant and annoying recommendations covering the majority of my home screen i may reinstall i dont want to pay to be constantly recommended content that is far removed from my personal tastes,0
too many ads,0
i hate how recently a lot of songs loose their lyrics on here after the recent updates anyone else hate this,0
love the 30 minutes of music at a time without ads,1
just great music love it ,1
service is great app is buggy,0
too many ads and everything else is just awesome,1
really like this app for music but im sad that you cant download single songs from off of an album you used to be able to do that but with one of the later updates that changed please bring that option back,0
i liked it before they started updating it i couldnt press any music and have to shuffle to press the playlist it used to be so fun but now im thinking of switching it or just doing something about it,0
the app was working well but some days ago an update made the experience using this app very irritating i restarted the app the phone i reinstalled it but it became worst i pay premium and now i cant use the service,0
i like spotify ,1
its better to listen on spotify rather downloading song,0
no longer works with my car stereo and this is where i mainly use it have to use it via bluetooth which means you cant skip tracks without touching your phone which is illegal in the uk please fix,0
if youre on mobile and you dont payits annoying they randomly put songs in your playlist and force you to shuffle the playlist leaving you with no choice but to listen to random stuffand if you wanna skip it you can only skip 6 times per limited hours and ontop of that theres a million adds,0
very good app probably best app to listen music podcast it supports underrated people which have talent and other app dont do that the only irritating thing is that advertisement but its ok,1
i really like this app but the ads are more,0
premium is awesome and never bugs out ,1
i dont mind the ads tbh but the way the ads are shown especially those ads about spotify premium really annoys me sometimes there arent much ads  sometimes therere ads after about every 2 songs i understand you want us to pay for your app but this is absolutely not the way infact it just makes me not purchase premium and just use some other app,0
autoolay problem ive disabled the setting but spotify still plays songs that are suggested instead of the actual songs that are in my playlist i have premium though its just straight up dogshit use youtube instead,0
enjoying all my favorite music  i really love it ,1
why am i not giving 2 more stars on phone you cannot play the songs of your choice from even your own playlist but you can do that on computer you can skip songs on phone only 6 times you cant even loop your songs and there is an ad time to time how to get rid of all of that oh just buy premium is it not too much that you have to buy something to even just pick the song of your choice or skip all the time premium for listen along sounds fair but for others not really,0
without premiumyou have to listen to playlists on shuffle with only 6 skips per hour and if you make your own playlist it will continuously play random songs outside of the the playlist as recommendations without any method to turn it off and cant skip them all since you only get 6 per hour and if you play a pre-made playlist it will play random recommended songs outside the playlist so you have to just add numerous songs to your liked songs and you rarely get to listen to the songs you want,0
annoyed app keeps changing out of liked musicdownloaded to lists i dont want frustrating when i pay for this,0
excessive ads completely punishing amount of ads 5x 30-45 second long ads for 2 songs then 3 more 30 second ads premium is cool and all but you shouldnt have to be forced to buy it unless you want a 34 ad based playlist never buying premium again this ladies and gentlemen is ad blinding 101,0
the app used to be great for years something has changed in the last 6 months i dont like using it anymore,0
fantastic app ive never searched for a song that couldnt be found spotify has everything ive ever looked for and then some love not having the commercials and a big library of songs never ending wonderful entertainment,1
i dont know whats happened in the last 2 updates but my musicpodcast will just stop playing several times in a hour very annoying and frustrating ive tried uninstalling and updating nothing has worked to fix this issue,0
great app everything works easy and well,1
very bad  i cant log in to my premium account i just did three days ago it keeps telling me something went wrong try again when am using the app but when i log in at the web its open my account but not on the app  and app is up to date updated  i have uninstalled and downloaded the app several times but still,0
love it still in early stages but easy to use,1
do bring the option to sort the playlistit was present earlier and with the updates it was removedbring it back its been very useful,0
it is a really amazing app i love it so much it has many options so that we find pirtcular song easily please add lyrics for other songs also  provide a download option wich will be useful to us when we are offline this app lags sometimes please fix it ,1
how did you ruin the listening session feature it worked so well before the update,0
ive always been super happy with spotify for a few weeks now though ive been experiencing the app pausing my music and sometimes you cant see what song is playing and you cant stop it without logging out ive reinstalled the app multiple times and have changed my password in case someone hacked my account its still playing up though i use spotify to play music in my yoga classes i teach and having it pause throughout class is making the app unusableplease work on those issues,0
wooo now it showing the features but some song are still unplayable whyand those songs are playable in other apps ,0
like the ease of picking out songs to make my own playlist and the connection to my bluetooth when i get in and out of car,1
it updated its self and now its not good i used to be able to see all my songs and pick witch one i wanted to listen to but now i cant see all of them and i cant skip songs witch doesnt help when i wanna listen to spusific songs and it keeps trying to get me to use premium with i cant afford its now really annoying and stressful id rather deal with all the ads on youtube then this pls if theres a way to fix this pls let me know i would appreciate it spotify pls fix this,0
absolutely fantastic all the music i want and need is here,1
it it too good music app during travel time it shows rarely ads and gives good sound and many more functiona i loved it i used to enjoy very much this app thanks and good luck spotify team,1
the experience is like 3-4 30s adds so you can listen to a couple songs or you spend roughly 5 each month for an ok experience i only use it because theres not much else,0
i recently got premium and everytime i skip to the next song it crashes,0
the app is good and all but why does it keep shutting down when i leave the app it happens every 2 minutes and the song starts playing from the first is there a way to solve this i have tried logging out of all devices reinstalling the app clearing cache is there anything else i can do it is getting annoying at this point thanks in advance,0
spotify was great till the app kept crashing continuously,0
all controls and views of current track have been missing from the app for days now theres s a looong thread on this in the forum with loads of users experiencing the same issue yet no reaction from the beast,0
spotify is my most used and favourite app i think of myself as a power user and im curious of how the spotify team sees me all this rating business to me is pretty tired having my phone ask to rate an app is something i simply dont care to do for the most part i start to wonder when will we move past this need to be better when can we just let be what is when can we transcend to a place where everyone has access to the best music all the time because we know music heals and is good,0
best music subscription app period no contest,0
thats absolutely good app i could listen the songs when ever i want that fantastic app  and i can listen any songs in this app even my favorite ones also there daily mix which there are givin are absolutely    super and perfect,1
simply amazing i do have the premium account but worth the money,1
love the app but i have a small question when i look for widgets you have two-one green one red doesnt matter which one i choose i always get the original green widget any reason for this not a problem just curiosity,0
awesome music app,1
thanks excellent and very power fully good,1
this app isnt worth it anymore the most basic things for a music streaming service is stuck behind a damn pay wall cant even choose your own music without paying and thats the most basic thing you should be able to do regardless this is just a big money grab and theres tons of apps better then spotify now even youtube music and thats something,0
i love spotify in my opinion spotify is the best music app out there change my mind you cant,1
a music platform that is so extensive youll never be bored its got something everyone filled with the old new and yet to be discovered diamonds in the rough the muisc just goes on and on,1
worst app not at all loading in 150mbos connection,0
super,1
this app does what i need it to and its free i dont have to pay like utube red love it ,1
this is one real good app for musics great job,1
i only have this app to listen to joe roganif yinz kicknhim off ill just delete your app as welli dont care about any artist you offer on herethere are alot of other music sharing appsan i stand with our brothers and sisters in canada ,0
get ads everytime i log in i get more ads than i do music you are trying to get people to buy the premium,0
worst app very slow loading ,0
please add a feature where i can shuffle all my playlists i will give you 5 stars,1
please bring back options to block artist songs and languages im really tired of hearing random german nothing against germany tho i love you guys,0
im happy for this app because i no longer struggle to play myself favorite musicim always updated than with other applications i was strugglingi love it too much,1
love the app ive been using it for 5 plus years and i dont remember ever having a problem with it it runs smooth and updates are barely noticed unless new features are added i highly recommend ,1
i pay for premium as does my husband but over the last couple of weeks while playing music the app just shuts down restarts when we pick up the phone and push a button we both have different phones and it does not matter if the phone is in use or idle we have a playlist for our wedding in 2 weeks and am now worried it will just shut off in the middle not happy at all,0
its very goodspeedy and does not consume much datambs,0
this app is getting more and more annoying i cant even open the thing its just getting stuck on the damn loading screen i waited for hours last night seeing if it would load but nope fix your damn app,0
new update completely broke the app - glitches widget is useless music doesnt play properly controls disappear constantly,0
absolute love love  spotify got all the music i would ever need always updated with the latest releases great playlists and variety for every occasion love the vast amount of songs available and the mood playlists it creates music lifesmilesunity highly recommended ,1
recently when i am playing a song it doesnt show what i am playing and the song controls are missing quite annoying,0
amazing sound quality  ads is an issue for a free listener,1
an advertisement app with some songs in it hehehe,0
star,1
ugly user experience and worst marketing strategy no proper usp in the application i was thinking to buy their service because of good playlists but the way they mock you to buy their premium i have uninstalled it and bought youtube music subscription instead spotify should learn something from google they never mock you they just remove the important features and once you start missing them you buy them thats how you sell something,0
most of the music app i have used but spotify is the best app ever it has 1000 of special playlist every time i have enjoying using spotify i love spotify so i have given a 4stars,1
my 2021 top songs when share it with people its not my songs its their songs,0
i had some problems with it not playing the song i wanted but i found how to fix it just go on your phone then spotify and do the same on your tv and play one song from your tv and you can play what you want from your phone after,0
not able to search song even when connected to internet this issue is there for quite sometime now need fix for this,0
please just stop why is it that random songs not even in my playlist just randomly play i just want to listen to the songs in my playlist in sure others feel the same,0
great app for listening to music easy to use the premium subscription isnt too expensive but it isnt very affordable either they have a discount for university students which is great,0
used many music streaming appsbut found spotify the best of all continue with this but keep updating the app,1
before i loved this app but after the recent update i cant do anything if i try to do anything but look at the home page i get the message to check my internet connection despite being connected no other apps are having issues and ive tried everything all the way to a hard reset of the phone nothing works so get it or dont but be prepared to delete it just in case switching to another app myself,0
best music app for me i use spotify when i want to curate what i listen to and discover new music but pandora to only discover new music where this benefits is that i can save songs and pick when to listen to them cant do that with pandora,1
the audio plays fine most of the time other times it drops entirely and i have to force close the app to get it playing again the video player is an absolute joke actually plays video like 20 of the time and even then its out of sync with the audio currently dealing with a new issue the songs are playing but my now playing queue is empty so i cant use my skip buttons on the lock screen or car stereo plus spotify wont pay labels enough to keep their clients comedy albums in library,0
i love the diversity of music real caribbean rhythm,1
app and service continues to get worse latest update broke the playback and make music randomly pause this update was released 9 days ago and still has not been fixed also this is a music app why are podcasts being put above music on the home screen,0
you need to remove the heart from the widget when the player is accessible in the lock screen i just decimated part of my playlist by accident because i thought i was hitting backwards instead of removing songs,0
i really like this application because i can listen to many of my favorite music and can sing because there are lyrics so singing becomes easier ,1
songs are easily accessible,1
censorship is bad and spotify is getting pretty heavy handed with its censorship due to authoritarian tyrannical pressure if they keep this up ill have no problem deleting this app since i rarely use it for anything other than listening to podcasts,0
spotify is changing and not for the better they have finally gone woke bands complete discography is no longer on the site its a bunch of live stuff and artist radio i used to love spotify since you canceled artists i may have to cancel you for good what a shame,0
super annoying to use for both podcasts and music when listening to a podcast sometimes it will skip either way back or way forward so you have to be on the app just to see if the podcast is on the right ep plus ads are atrocious sometimes the 30 min uninterrupted wont work and if it does work when its up youll get about 4 ads in a row before you can listen to your playlist again what happened to this app if there was a better music app i wouldve switched long ago,0
recently music starts playing but the music control doesnt appear until i restart the app after killing it just restarting doesnt work fix it please,0
this is one the best bocus and useless app during creating account  i had became fullly angry,0
updated and now i cant get video thanks spotify,0
just love music music is my life and spotify helps me listen to it,1
add song feature dont work as it doesnt play chorus of the song,0
best music app i have ever used,1
always great i have been a spotify premium user for 5 years  its been great friendly user interface always the greatest newest music in high quality i love the new blend mode with friends and the yearly reviews it would be really need to see a chat involved with the friend blends to comment and communate about tracks on them between each other,1
this is the best thing i ever ever seen in my intire life brooooo,1
i am a new client to your platform and hoping to every minute of it my stage name is herkledees a jamaican singer i am glad to be on your team,1
i love the app in general but lately theres been a lot of glitches i cant queue anything properly quick action bar disappears sometimes it even stops playing on it own im up to date on the updates restarting the app or my phone doesnt help,0
the app lies i tried listening to an ad to get 30 minutes ad free and got an ad 4 minutes later update now it doesnt do the 30 minutes ad free at all this app is such a pain to listen to music,0
has gotten better over time but certain bugs like shared playlists not showing up in the list have been present for ages,0
the app is unusable after latest updates its way too slow to load and crashes was better before update re-install did nothing if you use your phone exclusively for spotify it would be better to go with youtube premium or any other mobile music app update 2 unable to report joe rogans podcast aa misinformation and unable to remove it from being viewed spotify is the worst music app,0
amazing app,1
the app loses a part of its interface in which the app needs to be force closed for it to return frustrating to do that a dozen times every day,0
when i clicked the music that i want to listen to a giving me a different song,0
superb best music app out by far ,1
perfect for all my music and podcasts,1
the app glitches all the time the bar that shows the song thats currently playing never pops up and i end up having to uninstall the app to get music to stop playing sometimes ill try to switch to a new song and both the new  current song start playing at the same time im currently using a galaxy a12 please help fix this im having such a terrible experience,0
i like that i can create my own playlists and theres a wide variety of music to choose from,1
can you add the canvas option to african countries too,1
been working well until i decided to update the app feels like the worst decision i have made the app wont even login my details keeps crushing or saying i have no internet access yet i have a stable connection the only solution offered is to reinstall the app and thats a loss of all downloads,0
generally good lots of music i like a few missing things dont want suggestions fir kanye etc why doesnt it suggest more appropriate tunes,1
love it able to choose songs replay them and view lyrics i love it,1
its always nice to know where these companies stand spotify chooses deadly misinformation,1
the one must have to have downloaded first whenever i get a new phone  keep up the good work and keep music free,0
why is anyone paying you when your app both on android and windows does not work properly when offline what is the point of downloading to either if i cant access it when internet is limited or unavailable,0
i love the music,1
im on free trial and plan on keeping upgrade when trial is over they have sold me on commercial free good music playlist with music i like,1
the best music streaming site there is,1
great tunes that are easy to load to your device,1
wonderful appit gives me comfort and keep my soul in the mood i choose as far as music is concerni never get tired of using this apps,1
best song app ever,1
the app updated recently and now the app crashes when the play button is clicked please do check on this issue,0
too much advertising while playing songs boring app,0
am paying for premium but getting advertising still in podcasts whats up with that,0
the ads keep playing over and over and you cannot pass them horrible,0
the sound of the music is clear,1
so many bugs have to constantly close the app completely and restart because the player dissapears or doesnt respond to commands,0
worst after creating an account it shows something went wrong try again this is showing for the past one weekworstify,0
what l absolutely like about spotify is l can listen to a fantastic array of music with out trying to find my cd collection and then i find out some of them wont play l its convenient and it sounds awesome through my sound systeml would like to thank you whoever you are that created this site im wrapped ,1
spotify is allowing misinformation against vaccines in its platform just canceled my subscription,0
used to love the app but now i cant acess my liked songs it just says somethings wrong try again over and over and over and my whole library semms to have just vanished,0
when i would search for an artist in a playlist and hit shuffle play it would shuffle play the songs from that artist only now it just shuffle plays from the whole playlist fix this please coz this is a hugh thing for me,1
this app is fantastic all the music is free,1
when i first joined spotify it was great but now the advertisements come up about every 2 songs and its usually 3 commercials at a time ill be looking into pandira or other music apps,0
this is the best app to listen to music to,1
app has annoying bugs if device memory is low it would just fill it all up until the phone is out of memory there is no way to set maximum storage and spotify folks are not smart enough to use sensible values,0
video playback doesnt always restart without a full app closure,0
why when i click the sound i want to play it not the song i wanted this is a bad app,0
excellent,1
i love it i can listen to music everywhere i want ,1
playing doesnt show track and have to close and reopen to get it working fine each time  giving folder option will be great,1
love this app podcasts also help me a lot,1
i love this app i have found everything that i have looked for most apps dont have a lot of contemporary christian music keep up the good work,1
playlist problems ive used this app for years and recently its taken a serious dive it will randomly start playing random songs in the middle of a chosen song i will start playing my playlist and it will start with my song and as soon as its over skip to a random song ive never heard,0
apparently an app that prioritize false information over good music,0
many ad and not connection to internet,0
too many adds constant issues with skipping to next song practically useless,0
the songs i add to my liked playlist dont add anymore i cant scroll or pick between genres anymore and podcasts dont play fix it spotify,0
you should be ashamed of yourselves 1 uninstall until you drop the antivax propaganda podcasts,0
i love this app sooooo much the best thing that puts this app apart from pandora is that the music you search up is fully that music love this app,1
new update sucks cant connect to headunits anymore only reason i spent money for premium,0
app was good but the song stops again and again and we have to go in app and play it again from starting it is just so irritating pls fix the issue ,0
lots of adds that collapse mind while hearing songs,0
spotify is really great service i use it quite a bit i wish they would bring back car mode for the people who cant afford the 80 spotify car thing remote,1
gives you the best musical access experience,1
amazing it helps me to listen to song even when im on another app like i study maths with music so it helps me a lot best app ever seen as a kpop stan too,1
has been glitching lately but other than that its super reliable and easy to use,1
great finding all the songs i want and ones i never knew about,1
spotify has gotten extremely buggy in the last year or so i will sometimes get redirected to a playlist radio when i try to shuffle play a playlist and once in a while it pauses what im listening to and the now playing bar in the app and the control widget on my notification screen disappear ive been a premium member for years and hope these problems get fixed soon but it looks like theyve been known issues for a while,0
i love this app they had me at the start of the free trial and ive been in love ever since,1
its nice,1
i had pandora since 2013 maybe before then i cant remember when i found out about spotify around 2017 i have never used anything else for a music app i think ima stick with this for a long time unless something better comes out,0
love the playlists and ability to have group sessions even though i havent fully used it yet would love if they started adding tiny desk concert versions of songs,1
great service when subscribed but terrible free service with way too many adds and basically no features except shuffle plau on a phone,0
just enjoy the music and appreciate the free plays,1
i downloaded the app since they supported joe rogan and since i hadnt heard a full rogan episode since the spotify buyout the day after i dl the app they say they are going to put dangerous thought warnings on some of his episodes should have just deleted right then but i just gave them strike one now they deleted over seventy episodes byeeeeee,0
just started using spotify but so far im enjoying it,1
the new update is just horrible i dont like the fact that i need to pay to listen to what i like its absolutely infuriating and the offline update you never did it unless you go back to the old update then the one star is all you get,0
periodically stops and starts podcast episodes ive downloaded will lose play bar so cannot playpause have to force stop app to get it to stop playing,0
app is unusable in the last 3 weeks music stops playing with locked screen control bar and recently played is also missing this is completely unacceptable for a service that we are paying for,0
i used to love this app a few months ago but now its really frustrating to use i cant even choose the song i want to listen to before an ad suddenly pops up least to say im pretty dissapointed in this app just update to a version that can be easier to use,0
like seriously they dont even deserve half rating so many ads i really want to kill the people who are speaking in those ads plea spotify not everyone can have premium i swear to god even if i become a billonare i wont buy premium lets see what you guys do for this stupid ads people are deleting spotify,0
in one word the app is fantastic but im giving it four stars because spotify doesnt have the feature of lyrics translation i mean one cant translate a songs lyrics into any other language such as- you cant translate the song raabtas lyrics into english from hindi,1
appreciate you guys still standing for free speech keep up the good work,1
ok app allows easy access to lots of music and podcasts  ,1
spotify is a great app for listening music the best but podcasts oh man it terrible yeah it got ton of exclusive podcasts but podcast section of app really messy and a hassle to operate please add a separate section dedicated to podcasts or just launch a separate app for just podcasts because honestly i cant listen to spotify exclusives on another apps and i dont want to listen to them on spotify its a loss-loss situation for me,0
poor user interface you have to wait 10s for albums to load even when offline why does the app keep trying to connect when in offline mode and phone airplane mode,0
when playing the song its very good because of the audio quality but what i dont like is that the song plays randomly it cant be repeated when the song continues and also i just want to play a song while doing homework why do i have to go to a premium account,1
i just hate this app there are way too many ads like it comes every 2 songs or so and you cant chooseplay a specific song random songs that are out of the playlist start playing also i cant play a playlist that has less that 10 songs without random songs playing like its sooo annoying if you really want to listen to music more comfortably and freely i do not recommend spotify you could use other apps,0
paying is really tough on the app ive tried various debit cards but still no way out kindly fix this or probably create more payment options for nigerians,0
cant play whatever i want it only plays on shuffle playlists,0
ok,1
i am so pleased to have spotify to enjoy my music,1
still somehow getting worse songs just stop playing out of nowhere takes 3 or 4 trys to just load up the app once again great service awful app,0
this app is just awesomeif you are a music lover like me then just go for it,1
love being able to find and listen to my favs,1
it was amazing but now it sucks bad i turnned off the autoplay setting and it still gives me random song i dont want to litsen to i wish i could give negative stars,0
constant glitches lately plays for a second then pauses on bluetooth speakers yet i cant pause it when playing on my phone speaker - the controls completely disappear stay away on android  app is getting unusable on pixel 6,0
overall good but i cant share lyrics and no any updates,0
i wish i could share my liked song list to friends ,0
this apps is not good i cant disconnect to monthly subscription ,0
why do i need internet connection to listen to music i downloaded thats stupid your app is stupid,0
my favorite music app works great all the time i never have issues with it,1
this app used to work well everywhere now i cant skip anything and i can not even use this on my ps4 without it skipping playback that you miss half a song and there is no playing now bar on my lock screen or in the app,0
nice ,1
its ok put up with the comershals and is good free,1
im always finding hidden gems on random playlists,1
such a good app but just let me listen to my own music i wish i could pay for premium but geuss what am still a teen with no money so its bs,0
100 million to joe rogen but cant fix the bugs in the app,0
so far so good recommendation - make it fun and easy to search wonderfulunderrated song by introducing some kind of voting mechanism by user and display it on billboard updated weekly the song ranking by world or country disadvantage - some song especially cover by someone else  instrument song are not available but other platform like youtube have reason for subscribing - to support artist to make wonderful song - searching for wonderful song,1
the ads are less frequent which has allowed me to really think about getting the premium service,0
luv listening to music spotify is the best,1
app is not working properly and continues to state no internet connection whether im connected to wi-fi or not most of the time i am connected to wi-fi and would still get this message and i am not able to play any of my songs unless ive downloaded the playlist for offline listening this has been occurring for months now now it is more frequent and the app doesnt even work for me most times spotify is great but if i cant listen to my music whats the point of the app or the membership,0
so bugged been bugged since ive used it for years have to uninstall and reinstall at least once a week to fix certain issues,0
nice app but i cant access lyrics on my samsung a03 please i need a fix,0
i have been using spotify for years now after switching from ios to android and i absolutely love it dont have to worry about purchasing the songs and the device options for connecting are excellent i especially love that i can connect it to my fitbit,1
love being able to create my own playlists and the suggestions given are always on point,1
excellent selection easy to use and doesnt interrupt my other apps great app thanks for keeping it free makes life easy just like music eases the mind spotify is my mind ease app,1
i love this app however recently its been glitchy i cant control the songs the control features are gone the app stops please fix soon,0
update 2422 will not connect to the spotify app on my kenwood ddx775bh i have an android but my girls i-phone works with no issues it is good makes you high makes you really want to go,1
the app is getting worse and worse with every update its not showing me the people i follow plays random songs in the middle of music im already listening to doesnt show what song im playing anymore does not have podcasts even though i have premium does not let me view new songs by artists i follow and keeps giving error something went wrong at this point it might just be easier to use a different app than to deal with the hassle of this one,0
car mode doesnt work anymore please fix ,0
love the oldies that come up the ones that bring back great memories,1
it used to be great but now i have to delete and re install the app to be able to control my songs or itll be stuck saying one song but play another,0
best app for any of kind music but in some songs the lyrics are not available but overall i love this app ,1
i love it,1
never seems to play the artists i choose or favorite always pushes music that i am not interested in pandora does a better job or has a better algorithm or maybe spotify just pushes artists that they want to publishize,0
too much of advertisement its irritating,0
better than apple but still constantly lags or just purely wont open even when connected to internet they need to actually make it where premium users can use it offline instead of just black screens,0
if there is a way to sort downloaded songs by artist that would catch you guys up with 15 year old music players also can you manage to show album art properly for a whole week straight and the now playing bar doesnt always show up now and whatever is causing that also keeps me from controller music with my car or earbuds just dont be trash for 3 months straight dare ya,0
this is my best streaming service for music in the world,1
always show no internet connection when all apps open,0
i had spotify for a few weeks and i had a whole bunch of liked songs and all of the sudden all my songs are just snippets of my songs that ive favorited and i know its because i ran out of my premium trial and when you dont have premium youre limited to so little stuff you get so many ads and you can listen to your favorite song and you only get 6 skips and hour thats so dumb and stupid change spotify i might as well listen to my music on youtube and thats what ill do so dumb,0
i have to download the songs on pc and save the cache at specific location and when i try to restore the songs with same cache after reinstalling the os the cache doesnt work again i have to download the all the songs its the waste of my time money and data after paying all that money to spotify,0
spotify is the best if youre a music lover i recommend you guiz to download this,1
dude i hate how you cant just play one song and you cant go back on play lists you have to finish that song once you start it if you dont have any more skips this app has changed alot and i hate it,0
love all the different music and mix,1
i use the premium version of spotify so i can create unlimited lists listen offline avoid commercials etc but when i listen to shows like jre my ad free isnt ad free you have my money so that i dont deal with ads i want 0 ads the radio curating is not as good as pandora other than that its a great app update get it together spotify my content regularly stops playing for no reason  the now playing bar disappears randomly seriously would switch but idk to what,0
has been awful for weeks now it will just pause while listening all the time or wont load for some reason now its crashing ill find another streaming service fix it or im out,0
i hate the newest update i cant see what songs i have added into my own playlists the app just generally sucks i also have it on my playstation but i am genuinely scared to even go on it because how bad spotify has became,0
cant see albums in the artists page any more,0
very beautiful app  easy and all of songs is available  fora bara ,1
i love the high quality sound,1
it seems spotify is abit clickish but free is greatness,1
they say ads every 15mins what they dont say is its every 2 songs and ads run about 15mins to 2mins which is just ridiculous dont believe me spotify look at my user log using my email address thats illegal uninstalling now i gave yiu money for 3 months and as soon as i deactivate you bombard me with nuances unethical done goingbacktoyoutube,0
best music app around,1
last update now renders my playlist useless app stops playback all the time and cant start again have to start from the start all the time happens 2-3 times every 30mins,0
love it the only problem is now we can collaborate with other people without getting premium and now whenever you want to hear a preview for songs before you add them it wont let you honestly its kinda sad because ive had spotify for awhile and they changed a lot of stuff to premium ,0
alot of great songs but i can never play mines instead spotify recommends random songs that i do not want to listen to i just want to listent to follow you by imagine dragons in peace without other songs i just started using the app so maybe there is a feature that allows you not to have to experience this inconvenience,1
good working,1
the newest update had my spotify acting very lame and funky was having similar issues to some of the other latest reviews i uninstalled it and installed it again works like a charm now hope this helps somebody,1
the app that i can never get enough of the music app by spotify it will blow your mind how they will play the kind of music that i like to l listen to and plus you can follow them on facebook if thats your thing plus if you got the extra money premium is the way to go because its a contributing play without the annoying commercials its my top pick of apps thanks,1
good music and very clear sound,1
amazing i use this at least twice a day,1
i cant support an app that gives a stage for deadly disinformation agents too many lives have been lost because of evil a holes that promote antivaxer propaganda,0
this app is so good and it free not like other apps that you have to pay to listen to music,1
spotify plays all of my favorite songs and lets me make my own playlist,0
a great music service,1
annoying ads but otherwise good enough,1
trun yadav,1
too many ads dont get me wrong its totally ok to advertise your product but when im trying to listen to 1 friggin song i get at least 3 to 5 ads this needs to be fixed please like maybe 2 ads every 8 songs or something,0
it is very nice music app,1
good,1
real nice interface easy to use,1
i prefer the old ui but i dont see myself replacing spotify,0
this app is really amazing i just have one issue with it  its that when im playing a song my lockscreen changes to that album cover instead if you guys could include a feature to turn off that wallpaper changing it would be just perfect,1
very reliable for meloved wide selection in all,1
the new update is just horrible i cant play songs i want to listen and instead have to wait for it to play next please fix this,0
for the past 3 days it keeps showing no internet connection when in fact there is internet connection this isnt the first time but there has been breif periods where it connects and i update my playlists but this time it hasnt connected at all in 3 day i thought the new update will fix it but still nothing whatever you messed with in the app reverse it to the way it was last year,0
very nice ,1
work perfectly i can listen to what i want when i want it just needs a rewind feature for free users,1
i used to love this app i use it for 8hours a day most days over the last 6 months it has become worse and worse it crashes i loose the controls it pauses for no reason songs cut out i have really started to think about switching to another service,0
hello i facing a problem sometimes it turn off suddenly and no pop up when music was on i have to keep install and uninstall this app and it kinds annoyed me sometimes please fix this bug i was using samsung a73 g,0
i can play song remotely anymore yamaha music cast wont work chromecast wont work terrible i am so close to deleting this app and my subscription,0
keeps crashing every few songs,0
i absolutely love spotify i get to listen to all my favorite songs whenever i want i have premium and it is just amazing,1
why the apps is not working fine lately music stop it logout by itself,0
its good i enjoyed all of the songs the quality is next level ,1
nice but the ads i dont like and fact that you can not start the playlist from the start ok i dont know ive had spotify for ages but it can be just annoying sometimes but i do love spotify,1
i love music and podcasts sooo,1
this app has everything youd want for your music and weekly updates based on your taste the new remote bluetooth feature is incredible and fun my phone doesnt have to stay on the whole time best music app ever,1
i have been thinking of getting premium but even if you dont its still an amaszing expeiriance,0
the so takes forever to load playlists,0
keeps adding random songs the advertisement is too much and please bring back the okd update where i can stop or play the music when im on the other app,0
first time in like 5 years of not having spotify premium due to financial issues little did i know that it is completely unusable as a free service anymore absolutely shocking companies that forget their roots also lose customers next month ill be back on my feet and will use amazon music instead,0
app keeps going quite every couple of seconds for every song that i play other apps plays fine except for spotify,1
awesome app can always find the music im looking for,1
everything is the best except ads i know ads are to be there but if we dont wany premium then even 1000 ads wont change my mind stop begging to buy premium account,0
very nice app once you have premium only 10easy to use and always has the newest music,1
love it  it plays the music i love,1
would never recommend free spotify to anyone but if you can afford premium this is the best app for music ever,1
this is the best music app i have ever had it has everything you must get it,1
amazing but i miss the ability to have all your music compiled into one playlist,0
am really enjoying the best christian music and old school music here,1
brilliant music  and very enjoyable,1
great experience only issue is with downloading songs the downloaded songs disappear after 1200 am,0
it is really difficult to login and log ou into ur account from different devices,0
almost unusable on samsung phone,0
any song i search for spotify delivers awesome,1
wth spotify now i cant listen to music that really want to now i have to click shuffle wth it was better from the last version,0
app works fine my issue is contentcensorship if youll bow down to a bunch of hollywood types over their dislike of one guy youll do it to others it starts with one and snowballs what if these people said they dont like rock music that you need to remove all rock music would you cave on that its a choice to listen to either thing you dont like it dont listen its simple tell those people to start acting like the adults theyre supposed to be,1
its always a full filling experience listening to favorites and checking out the newest and greatest,1
its a good app but really restricting for free user,0
the only thing making your app distinct is the downloads i love its appearance but the storage usage on android is overwhelming even when i allocate it to the sd card with that being said i might switch eventually if im not satisfied enough because the price is relatively ok,0
while giving ads in kannada channels use kannada songs we have countless superb songs in kannada respect kannada and karnataka,1
removed the android widget removed car view ui is garbage overall your product development roadmap sucks every update makes it worse you keep bugging us to enable invasive bluetooth device sharing on every app launch with no option to definitively say no the playback controls now disappear during playback seriously heads need to roll on your development team,0
im looking for something thats extremely hard to find in the 21st century uncensored truth thank you joe rogan and thank you spotify,1
however old however young spotify has the music etc,1
cool please add spatial audio spotify,1
ive paid for premium for a pretty long time already worked great just today it started crashing cant listen to a full album plays six songs crashes then i have to open the app all over again and press play,0
for the umpteenth time spotify has undownloaded playlistsalbums with a claim that you have to connect within a number of days in order to keep music downloaded i connect to the internet every night including last night today my entire library has been undownloaded i listen to these playlists daily this is absolutely ridiculous for an app that costs 10month what exactly am i paying for the whole point is to have accessible music when not connected or paying for data im fed up,0
its like pandora but you can make your own playlist,0
stop breaking the app with useless ui updates and stop removing music you dont like the politics of,0
unacceptably buggy playback freezes every time an ad finishes and i have to force close the app repeatedly to get it to play again update new bugs now i get a black screen when playing a video podcast keep it up guys,0
great content smooth streaming good suggestions,1
only thing i would change is when i make a file of songs dont put in suggestions i made that file to listen to the songs i chose,0
this app is fine everywhere but casting it screws right up and just keeps skipping the songs forward with not even a second between skips,0
dont show plan expiry warning and remove all downloaded songs i was listening my songs and i heard add and i got to know that my 1 year plan has expired i renewed it but all downloaded song were gone spotify should lock these song or show option to clean its second time its happening if its happen during travelling or in journey then its hit differently so please make this option where it can keep our downloaded songs and give us option to delete until set lock on themthank you,0
after the latest samsung update the playing now notification in the notifications bar and lock screen no longer appear little inconvenient to have to open up the app every time you want to change a song daily mixes are good but extremely repetitive,0
all collection of songs are available happy to use this app,1
if you listen to music this app for you lol,0
i love spotify so much theres a ton of songs and its an overall great app i wish spotify premium wasnt so expensive though 10 dollers a month is quite steep for what your getting,1
apps been very glitchy lately doesnt even show what song im playing until i close and reopen the app its annoying,0
no longer interested in this app limiting thoughts and ideas expressed because they temporally conflict with a political agenda is dangerous and not something anyone should support goodbye spotify,0
cant play any song if i play a song it will quit,0
this app has become too buggy and bloated to be reliable generally great content and previously invaluable now more annoying than its worth,0
always had good things to say about spotify until recently playing songs without info like now stuck on old songs etc etc buggy do you not employ testers sort it out you bunch of helmets,0
constantly tells me no internet connection on wifi and data,0
amazing im able to replay my favorite songs,1
the free version is great just make alot of playlists with a couple songs on it will let you choose which songs you want to hear the ads are a little irritating though especially if youre trying to sleepthe paid subscription is very nice and will allow you to listen to most songs all in the order you want the only thing that would make it five star is a couple artists albums arent on it overall amazing,0
i am having some issue with spotify in my phone it opens a lot slower than other apps in my phone i also compared it with other phones and only in my phone there is this slowness i researched and tried everything i could but it did not solve the issue other than that it is a pretty good app,0
good app but they keep making my favorite songs unplayable and they dont have autograph on my line,0
recently introduced bug where sometimes the app wont realise its playing and wont show the play controls meaning you cant pause or skip,0
granted they fixed whatever strange bug screwed up the app but it still crashes occasionally it likes to stop and pause then play the audio randomly and often still a long time user but undeniably frustrated 410 until its fixed,0
i am not able to update my payments for the past 2 months just debugging all credit card and indicating there is no service or network problem,0
what have you done to this app i stopped using spotify because i get youtube primeyoutube music for a better deal its better value for money  - i can watch my favourite youtube 6  listen to my favourite new music on the go much cheaper than if i buy both i have a separate youtube accountg mail because my son 18 years old likes to play silly bollocks with my favourite app in the uk,0
best app for the advertisement iam seeing two adds after 1 song please check it,1
hello why spotify alwasy automatic playing while i am open the apps i was find setting to turn off but there is not an option for that i am using samsung galaxy s21 and also s22 in the same case please fix it or just garbage for a while if not fix,0
this app sucks i cannot repeat song and it adds random music i dont even like why is spotify like this this is totally messed up,0
great music lovers appreciate it,1
its unfortunate that i used to love spotify until the latest shuffle update which i find it unreasonable i cannot even play the songs i want i think its unthinkable,0
this app is actually good so far and im new i started 2 or 4 days ago and so far its doing great but there is a issue there is not a speed up button so i can speed it up i would love to speed up the music im hearing the audio is pretty good and if your wondering spotify lets you listen while offline unlike youtube music,1
love being able to listen to a specific album,1
this app is good in some ways the choice of music is great but i hate how if you dont have 15 songs in your playlist then spotify will put songs you dont even like in there for you also i cant leave my playlist on without it switching to a random song ive never heard or put on my playlist after like 30 minutes of listening you can just make a playlist on youtube with your favorite songs on it and none of this would happen not an amazing app,0
good app,1
recent update appears to have broken car thing as well as general notifications and even basic continued playback thr car thing issues appear to be related the the app not serving up notifications for playback update 4-29 issue seems fixed,0
easy to use and enjoyable the music available is fantastic,1
well ive been using the amazon music app that is about ten dollars a month spotify is way more up my alley lots easier to populate your lists helpful suggestions high bit rate sounds great the thing is im listening to classical music,1
to good to otragesce i like it i like a lot like i like a rollo and i dont chere,1
 spotify is the absolute best music and podcast app ever i couldnt live without it now soooo much better than youtube the fact one can play a podcast in the background whilst doing other things on my handheld device makes it an absolute cut above the rest  the amount of free quality entertainment is mind blowingthank you spotify xoxo,1
its good but i hate the new update i cant choose my songs and spotify adds there own songs even when i have premium,0
tons of music and great streaming choice,1
love how spotify always plays what i want to hear and i love the lyrics section and the hand- picked playlists cant live without it,1
love it just i dont like the recommended songs and then u get ton of playlist u dont like,1
ive used spotify for like 6 years and i have never been happier with it,1
it was good but add a option to listen to only that one song like the final countdown when you want to play it and only listen to it add a button that only listen to that song on repeat,0
way to many advertisement i get 1 or 2 but but 5-6 after every other song,0
it just a very good app only down side is it glitches sometimes,1
they remove all the good song stupidify,0
video playback does not work on pixel 6 pro ive cleared both caches forced stopped reinstalled the app doesnt work at all on a brand new device premium problem even though the app is in the play store they require all your personal information why do you need my home address to listen to music if you read why they explicitly state they give andor sell this info to their partners thats ridiculous,0
premium is simply the best way to go affordable and being able to download your playlists are absolutely fantastic great quality of life if your service is spotty,1
is bunch of dumb thing because you must pay to skip a song or go back to a song and it is stupid because you run out of skips so is basically like a game you running out of lifes so im very unhappy ,0
current update is garbage controls disappear so cannot pauseplayskip at all - even using bluetooth controls pauses at random and whenever notifications come in every single update makes this worse,0
the best music app since napster lol but seriously its a great app,1
last update has ruined this app constantly crashes wont load things correctly time to find a new app,0
best music podcasts app available,1
i like songs that ive listened to and songs i havent listened to yet,1
my cultivated favorites playlist is the best musical experience ive ever had,1
in the last week the playbar is gone except to play no pause forward and back it also does the same when on my bluetooth in my car and i also get 2 sec of silence every minute whatever spotify did on its most recent update did more than intended and it needs fixed,0
endless play list of my favorite  songs ,1
excellent so far,1
having so much issues recently playlistalbums downloaded not playing offline in its entirety having to close the window and reopen for it to play after having it idle for a while what are alternative apps though ,0
ive used spotify for years and have payed for premium for a few years now recently the app has started skipping and cutting the music like a broken record the problem stops when my phone screen is either unlocked or at least on ive tried all of the recommended fixes online none of them have worked if the problem persists i will be canceling my premium subscription,0
best music app everrrrrrrrrrr,1
excellent apps for music lover,1
i cant open the app anymore since i updated it,0
i like spotify,1
good,1
always showing no internet even though music is streaming online,0
i went from giving 5 stars down to 3 because when im in the app playing music the controls for the music dont appear i have no way of pausing or skipping a song the widget for the app doesnt work either please fix spotify,0
fantasticamazing selection of all typs of music,1
usually a great app but the last week has been very buggy the now playing bar disappears and it wont let me skip songs whether through the app or through my cars bluetooth needs to get fixed asap,0
not working since last 3 days no support available,0
theres no point i had a recent review but i realized i was being too generous the creators are greedy just coming up of ways to force users to buy premium they dont even give you a choice why even make this app free the moment i press shuffle on my playlist a suggested song plays and i dont even like it and the ads aswell i doubt creators are even looking at reviews if i could ill give this app a -10100,0
app doesnt perform well but i like the layout and the features,1
i used to enjoy listening on this platform but now i hear more ads than actual music i cant preview music when im looking to add more to my playlists pls fix this,0
good app if you have premium if you cant afford premium probably just get sound cloud,1
app broken with most recent update,0
sound quality is decreasing,0
the best app for music all over the world,1
it was good for a while but now i cant turn off shuffle play so kys,0
ive been using spotify for a few years and like the variety of classic rock 1960s  1970s and contemporary christian music thats available the daily mixes based on my listening preferences is also convenient,1
is the only app i use to for my music needs i love the innovative features that create a radio playlist based on my own created playlist,1
hi can i download music from spotify and listen in other players i mean having the mp3 file that can be shared,0
with all the choices of music and podcast players out there its hard to stand out yet spotify does and does it fantastically i would never use anything else,1
love the easy access to the music and podcast,1
keeps randomly freezing shite,0
the music is really good and a great variety music from the twenties  thirties to the present yes some music recordings have been cut back but stills puts out a great volune varieties that makes spotify a very addictingand lovableby all means,1
i use spotify almost everyday for podcasts and music and my experience is always positive ,1
sound quality is perfect but too many ads without premium subscription which is disgusting thats it,0
since the last update this app is basically unusable it crashes so frequently no longer showing currently playing playing song inconsistently overlaying in google maps embarrassing that they would go live with update like this,0
the app is very very boring to use ads pop up after every song or two for every 5 minutes of use you have to hear about 30 seconds of ad i have been using this app for about a year now but i have been disappointed by this app and hope you too until and unless you have the money to buy premium i recommend you not to download this app it really just sucks,0
i loved this app until it started glitching really bad galaxy 20ultra - yes ive updated everything - if i pause spotify to do normal human things likeidk listen to a person when talking or take a phone call connectdisconnect my car or literally do anything else with my phonethe playpause feature disappears  i have to restart the app this happens literally 5 times a day considering unsubscribing at this point sups annoying,0
didnt turn shuffle on but after last update every playlist just shuffles every song,0
there are too much ads i know there is premium for ad less experience but still too much ad,0
its good,1
why the hell does it keep adding songs just let me listen to my own songs and so many adds you have to pay to basically even use it,0
pretty sound pls give us back the preview thing when adding songs,0
this app is so very annoying and i dont really like the new update of the app we want the old one were we can listen all the musics we want just for free and not building a choice wherein you have no choice but to buy premium the creators are too greedy this app sucks bring back the old spotify we knew before,0
i really enjoy all the songs you mixed for me love it,1
absolutely the best experience app when im facing down moodthrough any song by using it without any charge,1
love it to bits get all my favorite music and my old time evergreens,1
lots of bugs on samsung note 20 ultra,0
fix the app what is the point in paying for something that crashes all the time actually i would be lucky if it crashed because it wont open most of the time i am also tired of reinstalling it to work only a few times,0
fix whatever happened with the latest update my music stops playing constantly and just starts randomly again,0
premium user for years its difficult to report issues  find support outside of very basic user issues using their website podcast feature was a nice add but the your episodes playlist is limited and messes with downloaded episodes unnecessarily recently theres been issues with the queue not working properly i will rearrange in the queue and by the end of a songepisode it will clear debating if its worth paying for premium or if i should start researching other services to replace it,0
best music app,1
oh my god i am using this app for almost 2 years this app is amazing a d i took premium of it and now its sound quality is above than any other app i think this is the future of music apps i recommend you guys to plz buy premium at least buy a mini pack and try it i took premium of 6months after listening some music on this app amazing app deserves 5 star definitely,1
i love you spotify ,1
its the worst app that i see after changing my country it never plays the song that i touched on my screen instead of this it plays another song and i never listened a single song of my choice on this app,0
everything just runs so smoothly and its sp reliable for good music,1
i have upgraded to the premium version a while back and the experience has been great bring able to download my whole playlist is damm good,1
i paid for the app for a long time- kept cutting out iver and over spoke with customer service which was a terrible experience i had to repeat the issue over 15 times with different people then they just ignored me when i asked to speak with a manager as it had been handled so poorly went from a bad experience for a service i was paying for to absolutely terrible customer service where they do not care about the customer really disappointed,0
syncing galaxy watch 4 with spotify playlistnot consistent whatsoever app on watch does not recognize that songs have already been downloaded app crashes and when controlled by phone is slow to react the app needs drastic improvement for functionality,0
theres always problems where the display freezes and afterwards cannot be paused reinstalled multiple times and that usually fixes issue but recently audio started cutting as soon as a podcast is played and freezes on the nothing playing icon reinstalling doesnt fix issue cant believe this app is so buggy,0
not very good there are so many interuptions in listening,0
the best app for any thing music be it old or new school yah,1
it is a good app with most songs i have looked for are available but recently my liked songs are not showing when i log into spotify on my laptop and i have restarted the app and reinstalled it several times but i still cant see my liked songs so not sure why this is happening ,0
please update the play button at music it hard to play the music if i dont know how to use it,0
takes a little while to figure out how it works and stores but i can select my favourite tune anytime,1
i used this app i like it at the first time with no ads no nofications to join the prumiem but after this app with ads nofications evrywhere to join prumiem the app will lag you cant get inside the music,0
adding other songs to my playlist is very annoying,0
doesnt miss a beat love it my go to app for music,1
bro its a good app but like when u search up music it shows alot and when you click one it does not give you the somg you just searched it up so please fix it for a better rating,0
simply simply lovely,1
spotify is a good app with songs and podcasts they let me have a free option or pay for premium my only complaint is that they only give you 6 skips an hour 1,1
download feature doesnt work on my samsung s9 and that was a key feature that made me get a subscription without a subscription yt music is the better option,0
goool,1
i love spotify music and podcasts i can listen to all my music that i love,1
why does it keep switching the storage location to internal storage its so annoying,0
the music keeps stopping every 10 minutes fix your damn app youre a multi million company and your only job is to play music,0
bro fix the goddamn bug i cant listen to the song preview and the play button isnt there its literally broken,0
using very poorly designed inferior software only due to wide availability of music,0
it gets hung up sometimes interfacing with my vehicles bluetooth and wont recognize commands from my vehicle but other than that works pretty well,1
great music app pretty much the only one i use problem is it would crash every other song and make mad hope it gets fixed since im a premium user,0
doesnt seem to work with s22 im not getting any music controls to pause play stop the music cant rewind or fast forward the song i have to close down the app to stop music,0
its a good app i can listen what i want hehe,1
love it  though would love more old stuff too,1
wow you know my favorite songs,1
my music sometimes turns off even when my sleep timer isnt set but not often i really like the app but its unfortunate that we must pay so much to access premium features i guess 5 would be alright but 10 for just music seems like a lot even streaming services like disney charge less but the premium features are still nice i got it so i could download my music to listen to when i travel,1
it was fine until it kept crashing out of no where it will freeze and go unresponsive i dont know what causes it or how to prevent it its getting frustrating reinstalling the app does not work,0
awesome music selections for old school rnb,1
very good,1
the app just crashes when i try and log in,0
all bugs fixed so im upping my review use it daily and love it sometimes the ui can be clunky though,1
music stops after 4 songs before paying for this app never had this issue will have music going for awhile and music just stops then starts playing whenever it decides to come back on ugh now im paying monthly im having these issues make it make sense please,0
wont stop playing lynyrd skynyrd after every song doesnt matter what album i put on it plays one track then lynyrd skynyrd again spotify opens up randomly to play yes lynyrd skynyrd,1
is amazing because it simple plus when your out an about who doesnt like listening to music cached in your libary its money in the bag,1
i love spotify premium quality music app  thanks,1
i love the suggested music this app generates for me and im thrilled that spotify is not playing big brother giving in to the cancel culture censorship movent im a grownup with a functional brain so im not afraid of being exposed to misinformation and not being able to use my better judgement the true test of ones conviction to uphold our constitutional rights is allowing freedom of speech for view points you dont agree with exposure to different ideas strengthens ones own,1
enjoying the daily mixes sending so much unheard music my way,1
app is good but a lot of ads after some time,0
great app great music but for the last month or so i havent been able to listen without it not working when on other apps or having my phone closed and ive never had this problem before the reason i originally chose spotify was bc it works in the background but now it doesnt,0
it was good at first but suddenly it didnt let me play my favorite songs,0
its a good music platform i just dont like that it plays recommended songs when im trying to listen to my songs,1
been using this app for years used to be amazing recently it began to stop displaying the player controls on my home screen and in the app and it also stops playing content regardless of what it is at random used to be a 55 now it is borderline unuseable will update my review when these issues are resolved,0
love it got premium and never switching services 1010,1
restore all jre episodes i was tempted to join spotify and did download and use the app lightly these last two months as i wanted to continue listening to podcasts like science vs but this whole joe rogan experience debacle has shown how little they care for the 1st amendment,0
spotify give me previews back i swear to god i literally cant preview songs anymore and i am going insane i am kept up every night now because of this i have not once smilled since it stopped letting me preview songs fix your app or i will get violent,0
good but advertisement,1
not able to login after the new update even after trying all the methods,0
this app is absolute garbage for listening to podcasts was my last review but i was wrong i was being hot-headed and not understanding correctly i do apologize to the owners of this app it works really well,0
who legitimately thought that having the playpause button on the left was a good idea i refuse to believe there are actual humans working at spotify singlehandedly one of the most stupid changes ive had the misfortune of seeing,0
its good very good all tho my account isnt leting me log inwhyi tap my account and then loads for five sec and says try again same with my other emailfix it so i can listen again,1
love the music hate the ads,0
it a very great for hearing music,1
bestest app for all the songs it requires less internet speed it also works on that it gives the best sound quality i prefer you to plzz download it nd use it then plzz give us a good review,1
spotify used to be better now its just glitchy with one thing or another im constantly needing to restart the app because it wont display the info bar of whats playing which itself contains the playpause command i know its not a big deal but when im browsing through music i cannot bring up the title or song info to a whole screen and when i have to close and open the app it resets itself and i completely lose the song im only still using it because i dont know of another music app,0
way too many adverts too distracting,0
go to listen to music theyll play one or two songs and then well stop playing tried uninstalling and reinstall and it will work for a day and start doing the same thing,0
pretty bad experience with the app often cutting out the music very temperamental and really making me contemplate moving to a different platform app still syopping and not connecting to bt why do we put up with no fixes maybe if i stop paying,0
with no premium no spotify,0
very good overall never had any major problems couple of minor issues like songs very rarely continuing in silence after they finish but that could just be a glitch caused by my bad internet lol,0
still starts randomly while the playpause abilty is gone streams as it should still very buggy despite the app being closed and phone reboot it will still remain open in background and auto connect via bluetooth once this bug is addressed it will be a much better experience,0
last update now doesnt work with android auto when plugged in it trust to transmit via bluetooth and direct connect resulting in nothing playing great update guys,0
its way too restricting i cant play the song i want because it shuffles into a different song the ability to play specific songs without having to listen to songs you dont even want is the bare minimum they add songs into my playlist even though i didnt ask and you can literally only use 9 skips per hour lastly i cant even drag the timestamp of the song the experience is horrible after the update please fix this,0
the app stopped working and will not open past the logo screen have tried everything for days and still cant even login,0
i have installed in my android tv but whenever i play it the tv hangs and there is no problem with the apps even though i update the spotify on time,0
love spotify it keeps me going at work and in the car,1
i really liked this appit works well after exhausting my daily data limitthis app uses less data and also the sleep timer is very helpful for me fall asleepits helps in good listening to musici really liked this app that is why am giving five starsi will suggest this app for all music listenorsi cant get lyrics in my phone hope that fix it soon so that i give four stars where lyrics are available in other phones,1
very slow loading times since the update,0
i love this app but why can free acc cant turn off the shuffle i really hate this update for my opnions,0
ive had an amazing experience with spotify especially with buying premium and removing ads a great app highly recommended,1
this app is really good for music and we can also listen to the latest songs but there is some problems first of all the ads im not saying to remove them but atleast reduce them second of all the quality of music there are other apps which provide better quality try to give better quality in music and i do have to appriciate the playlist that the app makes for me most of the things are best in the app but try to fix the issues mentioned above,0
horribly slow doesnt connect to the internet denies me access to downloaded playlists offline,0
attention developers was a great app until the last update very buggy when there is a song playing i cannot access the screen that it should be on when playing and the little bar across the bottom that tells you what song and you can pause or play is gone i have to exit out and restart then it usually is there until next time i minimize it then bring it back up and its gone again please fix,0
over add,1
i like following luke bryan and they send him my way just as if i mentioned other country western singers luke is my favorite and his songs lite up my space,1
basically my paid premium subscription is okay but the shuffle option is a joke and has been for years every time the only way to hear different random songs from my 800 plus library is to play songs from the start no point asking to be fixed cause obviously its in the too hard basket very disappointing,0
friend activity tab and profile tab instead of the premium tab on androidios and change the layout of the play skip like and whatever buttons they look horrible,0
got good music on there but when i dont want to listen to that song it wouldnt let me skip it when i had not touched that button for well other 2 hours,1
this is getting worse and worse 6 ads before you play music is ridiculous,0
absolutely love this app its a must have when it comes to music,1
its great would be lovely to play the album dance with my father but i cant dont know why,0
its great to see my good friend joshua eli smith getting his music out there hes going to go far i enjoy hearing new artist that will be on the radio and the awards shows in the future,1
terrible app will not stop connecting to my car despite applying all the fixes found online i am deleting my account,0
best app for listening songs,1
best streaming stations ever,1
i like it becuse it has every song,0
ive always liked spotify and how it adjusts to my music tastes and changes the sele tion of available artists and songs is also awesome,1
for music its the best app,1
this app is great but one thing i hate with a passion is that you cant view the playlists you made separately from playlists you follow or download i cant express how stupid that is like it should be one of the first things youd be able to do separate your playlists with followed playlists come on it eats me up i dont know why it bothers me so much but it does 4 stars everything else is amazing,1
very good you can make a play list for free and it dont drain your battery like you tube,1
when first opened up spotify it was a 5 star thing until today i found out that i cant put on my favorite songs but had to shuffle them all until i get my favorite song not only that on my tablet it had the things that said that it didnt had to do the shuffle but just press on the full song instead of pressing on it for a sample of the song the things before the worst thing happened on my phone,0
i use every single day however i use music for day and sleep at night wish i had profile options i pay premium i want day music and sleep music to be separate because sleep music destroyed my recommended music for day time need day and night profiles for plaistow to keep algorithms separate options ,0
spotify sucks when you listen to it you cant go 3 songs at least without hearing five or six ads in a row you need premium to even use it,0
its great  a good music app but the problem is it has wayy too much adds its really annoying i also cannot skip to the songs u want to hear and limited 6 skips an hour i can only preview songs too also sometimes when im listening to one of my playlists random songs pop up and they arent even in my playlist and arent my type of music,0
it is a good aap but from last 2 days i was not able to play any songthen i uninstalled it and reinstalled it any i can not even login nowit shows u have no internet connectioni have even downloaded the lite onenot working too please spotify somethingi have to hear my playlist and my favourite songs please do something and solve my problem i even have full data pack and tbh i even have a wifi but it is not workingdo something immediately and solve my problem,0
ive never had these many bugs and issues with any other app especially from one with such a budget,0
i love spotify because it has my favorite song ,1
i say to them that i want the app and they make me download it im so happy they are so kind i love them they are so sweet,1
this version its worse you cant play a songthe old version is better than this please change for us if not you are going to loseits becoming worse,0
dis app are very good,1
i use spotify on a phone and oh boy its a nightmare first of all theres a ridiculous amount of addsyou only get six times to skip a song and it resets in an hour and you cant pick what song you listen to theres only shuffle,0
i am unable listen any song whenever i try play the automatically close without showing any error done all troubleshooting,0
the play menu button disappears when you stop playing the app and mimimize it i have to close and open the app just to access the play button please fix,0
this app used to be so much better when i first got it the ads werent bad i got it because i didnt want to pay money but recently the ads have gotten really bad it was the worst today i changed the playlist i was listening to and got 13 ads idk what the problem is,0
spotify has been a 5 for me in both the free and the premium version however the most recent update affected ui i have to close the app or uninstall and reinstall it so that i can see the music selection tab the update makes this tab dissappear on the mobile version also from my country i liked it when i had access to the voice option as i use spotify the most when i am driving and the voice option optimized my searches and music selection while driving ill update my rate when fixed,0
the only music app i use it has everything i could want except for some of my favorite comedians but hopefully theyre working on that so,1
great app good connectivity,1
best app so far no interruptions in adverts fast searchorganised musik experience,1
a very good app the ads are not too overwhelming and i like being able to get good music onto easy to make playlists however i hate that songs i didnt ask for are added to my playlist i end up listening to songs i dont like and cant skip more than my actual music sure this my be a nudge to premium but i feel this addition on mobile may cause for less people even attempting to listen here other than that an amazing app,0
i love listening songs in spotify,1
normally great experiencing a lot of crashes lately however,0
i already had an account when i installed it but it kept saying im offline and i had no wifi but my wifi was on maximum of the wifi i hate this app so i give this app 1 star also it didnt let me listen to my favourite songs,0
the app is good and has thousands of songs to choose from including podcasts and other types of audio experiences the 14 day free trial was nice as the standard premium is only 999 making it pretty cheap for the average user,0
full of glitches these days i often spend alot of time making a queue of songs only to scroll up and find it hasnt registered it and all that effort was a waste of time and you cant view your library in any logical order like alphabetically its decent for music availability but really annoying functionally,0
two days ago all songs from playlists i listened to were showed in the history of songs i listened to recently as just songs i mean there werent any playlists and then songs from them just songs it confuses searching now nothing has changed yet i need answers i have no idea whats happening and it extremely complicates using this app upd why cant i download music lol what now nothing changed either,0
so far i been using spotify it been a great app but there are some issues starting to appear i cant seem to listen and enjoy my playlist without having it pause by itself every one min or so keep doing so on many of my devices really disappointed really hope it could be fix soon,0
spotify used to be good before they got greedy and forced every single album and song into shuffle mode i wouldnt have a problem with this but they mix in reccomended songs which arent reladed to my music tase at all and with mixed with only 6 skips per hour it doent go well at all if you do decide to purchase their subscription you mostly unlock features that any other music player software has also they force their premium subsription down your thoat like its some sort of dessert,0
every once and a while when i start listening to music i cant see what is playing or pause it even if i change the song i have to close and reopen it sometimes multiple times just to get that ability back,0
made for money and is super inconvenient very controlling and feels like a violation of my rights,0
i love everything its user friendly etc,1
i enjoy the playlists,1
still the best among the restbunches of songs library perhaps improvement on recommendedproposed music or chartto be more relevant with user preferences needs an ai though,1
the only music app ive ever listened to and this year ive had much complications back in january if i private a playlist and want to make it public again it wont show on my profile this is still happening so when i want a playlist to be public i cannot make it private and public again because it wont show on my profile now i cant hear a short snip of a song before i add it to a playlist and its so frustrating to me fix it please spotify,0
ridiculous amount of bugs for a premium paid app cant pause songs anymore or see what is playing have to go into settings and force quit the app every time when playing through bluetooth and change songs it starts playing from the phone and have to reconnect the device downloaded songs wont play without an internet connection so whats the point downloading them the worst app i pay for by far,0
i love spotify and as a user since circa 2013 i like to think im think im an early adopter and have a lot of experience with the app that said the last 6 months its gone drastically downhill the app constantly closes with no crash report it just stops playing and it closes sometimes its playing and the app is not even showing as open which is fun sometimes its choppy and that may be a service issue but its only been happening the last few months not sure whats going on,0
asking questions from all sides of a topic isnt misinformation or disinformation which is why spotify is currently better than the propaganda promoting mainstream media news channels who are jealous of your viewing numbers perhaps if they would adapt to telling the truth for once their ratings would improve,1
its good and i love the app but it doesnt let me hear the music before i add it to the playlist which rlly sucks,0
it is very bad now it will stop after 1 song and often not playing in background the notification bar player doesnt match with the song it is playing and cannot control,0
doesnt work well with latest version of android,0
used to love this but cant even use it now it doesnt play anything anymore says no internet when all other apps working fine on net all playlists are apparently now empty i am paying for a service i cant use not happy at all fix this now or lose more customers,0
i love a wide variety of music and other genres spotify has fine selections of them everything you can imagine and then some ive tried other music apps but spotify is the best,1
good app for music and podcasts the free version isnt full of ads apart from one for spotify,1
recently this app not receiving internet connection even though internet is on the device keep saying no internet connection and downloaded song stop playing too,0
my favorite music app by far one of the very few subscriptions that i enjoy paying ive literally convinced my whole household of its glory spotifys interface is probably one of the most intelligent designs ive had the pleasure to toggle with i love you spotify i truly do i use this app all day long and all night it is the digital adderall to my all to real adhd,1
at least one bug problem i play my liked songs but it jumped into another playlist randomly,0
cannot properly play filter saved songs,0
s22 ultra constant crashing,0
its been a long time for me to heard anykind of song from this appspotify especially for korean pop song then suddenly after my latest update for the released new version this app having overflow lacks for its sytem as instance when i still play onto my music the song stopped out of the blue despite my provider is stable plus theres no disruption eitherand other lack in some feature which likely to much for me to write it all here for worlds sake please develop it beter odeveloper,0
the shittiest mobile music app ever tried to list to one of my favourite songs big shot ended up listening to a song from some weird cat game instead,0
cant find saved playlists on latest android update,0
canceled paid services after several years of constant annoyance with this app ui sucks stations randomly change genres all the time and now the app crashes every other song this and prime are the worst of the lot yt and pandora are hardly better no customer support just links to their community which is equally useless,0
sheesh,1
great app but playback buttons disappeared recently otherwise great appplatform and id definitely recommend pro,0
amazing appsmooth interface great collection,1
if you ever have an issue with spotify ask for medina m to help you they are the best and should be given a 15 raise forever in my memories medina oh take me back to the start i was just guessing at numbers and figures pulling the puzzles apart questions of science science and progress do not speak as loud as my heart but tell me you love me come back and haunt me -scientist coldplay 3,1
dont get me wrong i like spotify i just dont like how they add songs to your playlist i have a playlist i made specifically for my culture and what not and theyve added rap country and metal to it the songs are good i just dont like how they add random genres based off because you listened to,1
too many ads,0
has the best podcasts on planet earth cant get enough of the variety and open debate also their recommended music ai is second to none great work,0
am i the only one having poor audio quality on spotify i have tried loud and chosen the highest audio quality too,0
i really like this app i can find music i havent heard in decades man i can listen for hours thanks for having a damn good app,1
all are fine we can play in baground but ads we cant skip ads thats the big problem,0
never works properly anymore it stops letting me pause music and continues playing even when i turn my car headphones etc off used to work fine  update was fixed and is broken again now lol,0
why so hard for payment premium now why it must be with credit card,0
i really like it here every one is very nice and i now i will always come hear,1
listen to music on this app almost all day every day super affordable and has a very wide variety of music available,1
its become worse now its not even opening always notifys that spotify isnt responding pls fix this irritating bug spotify cmon u are the no 1 music streaming app cant have all these bugs,0
i really like this app but when i see it again it changed when i touched to play it the music it play just a little but when i play it shuffle the music is full please fix this app again to the original we always use  we love it,1
this app is okay but its kind of got too much going on in it hard to really locate stuff premium is really the only way to enjoy spotify,0
favorite app just love spotify  would recommend it 100to all intending users,1
i love this app and love listening to music on it just i have one current problem with it when i try add a song to one of my playlists it wont give the option to preview a bit of the song before adding it,0
i dont have premium which i dont mind the ads arent usually that intrusive however i have started receiving ads about promoting talks about religiousgod nonsense,0
thanks to spotify i have discovered so many great music that i couldnt find anywhere else even though the ads are tad bit annoying  no other music apps can beat spotify thats for sure,1
inconsistent ui where play toolbar dissappears when you switch apps also third party casting devices are sometimes dont appear in the list even they are in the network not able to control the sound with equalizer the list goes on,0
easy to play music,1
it relax the mind and feel better it is the best and favourite app,1
horrible not to mention on wifi with amazing bandwidth and speeds spotify is the only app that decides to hang worst experience ive had with music streaming apps and ive been through my fair share,0
i liked it when i first download it i could fast forward or go back in the song and when i looked at the song i could play that song now i cant even get the song that i want when i click on it i get a whole different song and theres ads now and i cant even fast order or go back and when the songs over i cant even go back to the song,0
amazing apart from the playing suggested songs part i find it stupid that we cant just play a playlist that we made without paying premium we already have limited skips an hour and a hundred ads inbetween pretty much every song,0
been a spotify user since it debuted and loved it ever since,1
one of the best music apps i used it has all the new music and the old once  i recommend it,1
i cant even listen songs i want it keep playing on different songs i didnt even add on my playlist also the autoplay in setting doesnt even work,0
this is the best music service ive ever owned spotify has an incredibly large music library and it syncs across all your devices you can even download songs for offline usage use your phone to cast music to any pc tv speaker or whatnot i literally use it every single day its a must-have for gaming chilling work and even school,1
i tried to make a playlist of my favorite songs but then it plays songs i didnt put on there and i have never listened to so spotify is the worst app you will ever have,0
this aapnis very nice i really love it listening to songs on it for atleat 3-4hrs a day plus i have premium membership i just had one question is the canvas mode not available in india,1
good app for your favorite songs,1
this app was the beater thing i ever had it is good than any other app other apps are fake they think they are 48 they are not they play your voice messages dont download them spotify is better as you can listen to good tracks like tranquilitymy favouriteby m huncho and you can connect to your xbox,1
i really love this app expect the add part which is so annoyingit changes the whole vibeand there are many songs which isnt added yetwill be waiting for that too,0
it is best for music field,1
i dont know what happened between now and last month but here lately spotify has taken away my chance to control what i listen to meaning no play nor skip buttons seem to appear as they use to it seems to go in car mode even when not in a car please fix this issue,0
its an ok app but it sucks bc they add stuff i never want to listen to and i never hear the stuff i liked,0
we subscribe so no ads joy,0
i dont know what theyve done but the recent updates have ruined functionality edit came back to give it a one star and looks like nothing has changed was constantly crashing yesterday while i was driving,0
poor music site with bad ethics they were better in the past but the direction they went over the past 4 years is just a bad user experience there are better music app services dont recommend at all,0
its a cool music app i can find all the songs that i want to play,1
spotify is my main means of listening to music which makes it rather annoying that the app keeps randomly crashing either a few seconds after starting it or even in the middle of songs not a great user experience right now,0
recently over the last 2 weeks spotify has been crashing i cleared the storage and cache thinking that was the problem i uninstalled it and installed it back didnt help what am i paying for if i cant listen to music uninterrupted,0
it has really good music playlists,1
its the new ipodbarely stable fails to load your que or playlist when connecting bluetooth sometimes and then crashes entire que if i had other options id use them but there arent any for android users unless i download all 200gb of my library but then theres no basic phone with that size memory ,0
this app is great so dont waste time and purchase a premium version though it would be much better if more 80s or 90s songs are available i cant even find the way i came in by lobo,1
the app bugs out on galaxy s22 ultra,0
i want to share with friends for a long time without changing accounts why can i only join another premium once a year,1
bit annoying on mobile but overall pretty good,1
ui is terrible  app doesnt even work half the time,0
update the app this is ridiculous paying for premium and it stops playing cant see whats playing next widget functions dont work also plays randomly play lists vanish cant control my music refund premium customers whilst its this broken,0
was good now it just doesnt work was fine last week then 3 days ago cant access anything on the app says no internet connection which is a lie as its working for anything else tried uninstalling and reinstalling logging off and on restarting phone and still not working grrr am going on a long road trip and want to be able to play the playlist i want cant even play recommend playlist might have to cancel subscription,0
amazing app i dont have to select songs after every 5 minutes during driving it automatically play similar songs and very user friendly ,1
it was terrible i cant even play the song i want it keeps taking me to a other one like stop choosing my music i know what i wanna listen to,0
better sound,1
great love spotify came over from you tube because spotify supported joe rogan love the music and now podcast i plan to stay as long as spotify doesnt start the censorship bs,0
love my spotify the biggest issue i have is since my last phone update everytime my phone screen goes black spotify stops i have been all over the ap and my phone cant figure out why,0
i enjoy having my spotify very convenient,1
ads are annoying but other than that its great ,1
dont know why i pay for premium when its constantly crashing and now wont load at all,0
the latest update crashes the app whenever i would try to add a playlist shortcut on my samsung phones homescreen but everything else is great,1
updated it about 2 weeks ago now the player glitches out and just dispears and randomly stops playing very dispioting after using the app for 2 years without any big problems,0
maan this app lets you choose the good song,1
use to love spotify was even worth the monthly cost for premium services but taking away the preview for a song is disappointingit was one of my favorite things it made adding to my playlist so much easier without this i wont continue my premium membership and may even find a new music app to use as my new main one,0
this ad popped up and my phone was locked no permission was given commercials and ads are getting worse and here is one of them,0
great when it works but crashes 30 of the time i try to use it need to restart my phone just to get it to work again,0
really great love the seldom and short advertisements thank you,1
i good app but i dont know how to turn off the shuffle setting ,0
why has my playlist of songs turned to short video clips of each song only,0
i enjoy using this amazing music its hassle free and easy to use,1
very nice user experience compared to other music apps,1
in general i like the app but if it lets you create your own play lists then it should allow you play it in the order you arranged not shuffled lower rating after i noticed that the majority of time im getting ads after every song,0
i listen to podcasts on my phone i really enjoy going to new episodes and listening to the latest episode of all my podcasts its how i start my morning,1
too much ads ,0
no prob with musicexcellent,1
the shock part of spotify is just a word in a song will be easily found and i had no problems example happy then find a song word happy and a list will appear your song been found 5 stars also can,1
even after getting new phone app wont play in background even after changing the settings,0
ive used spotify exclusively for my music for over 10 years now its the best i can recommend free version on mobile kind of sucks - but premium isnt very expensive at all especially as a student,0
its good if you have premium otherwise you cant pick a song,1
good music simple as that ,1
please introduce an option to hide podcasts or separate them im looking for music stop mixing podcasts in with it,0
there are buggs when you want to use your other device az a remote the track wont always skip,0
when i try to put the songs that are on my playlist it puts on random songs that are not on my playlist,0
it is incredibly broken right now cant listen to podcasts without it turning into chipmunk chatter had to uninstall and reinstall 5 times in the past week if its paused for more than 5 minutes i have to close and reopen the app,0
very good and i love the app but the fact that it doesnt shuffle and plays an artist song is what i dont like,1
music options work fine id love to be able to listen to my podcasts here i would move over if there was an option to mark multiple eposides as played instead of going through individually,1
spotify is an outstanding music platform with different genres for all types of music orientated people signed g,1
very good selection of songs,1
good ,1
love the ability to find obscure things that i cant find anywhere else,1
its nice but the ads are so annoying after every song theres an ad today there was 7 ads before the song yes i counted them and it was 7 these ads are all 30 secs to a minute long and when they are playing after every song it can get very annoying im listening to more ads than music,0
i love this app but there is lot of ad,1
its good for playing your fave tracks for free if you dont mind the interuption of adds every so often ,1
this is the best app i can listen to my all kpop favorite songs,1
wish i could actually listen to the song recommendation rather than 20 similatso gs everytime trying to listen to that one,0
glitches are rediculous even on brand new phone and will sometimes even play up to 5 minutes of ads with only 1 song theyre really trying way too hard to annoy people into premium,0
spotify needs to do better because whenever i play my playlist of songs i picked spotify puts other songs in that i never put it i absolutely hate that i am deleting the app shame on you spotify shame on you,0
its ok but i disabled the playback yet it still keeps playing suggested songs and its really annoying because the suggested songs arent even good,0
dont have canvas feature just boring,0
good,1
spotify has all music all for free and sound quality is so good i love spotify,1
shuts off every 30 seconds,0
really good app sometimes freezes and you have to close it but that doesnt bother me too much would be nice if it didnt do that tho,0
lately the app doeasnt show itself and i cant control it like pause or play or close it sometimes i restart the phone itself,0
perfect except i wish premium was priced maybe 5 instead of 10,0
so smooth and controlled,1
hey spotify what the hell is happening i am trying to login for last 30 minutes used multiple emails an mobile number but still its not working,0
its very buggy and has to be repeatedly restarted regularly to fix problems with the ui the playlist feature seems intentionally designed to make it difficult to put songs onto multiple playlists its sluggish and the algorithm is often incoherent with anything but obvious genre,0
update this app is becoming more and more terrible may move to other streaming service soon original post thanks for reminding me to review spotify this app has gone really downhill lately and pretty much every update is accompanied by bugs songs not playing queues disappearing new features not working focus on getting the basics of music playing right rather than unnecessary features that no one cares about,0
samsung note 20 5g ultra awesome app no problems easy to use,1
pretty goodthe only thing that just has to go is spotify let people download songs themselves stop putting random songs in a playlist i cant enjoy music and it messes up the whole playlist and experience and i cant delete the songs out of it,0
imagine having a service where you can download songs for offline listening but you need a connection to even get the playlist to load if you are going to take up space on my phone for these songs i should be able to easily listen when offline but i guess spotify doesnt care about actually providing a service that you pay for dont get this app if you are looking in the subscription service because its pointless,0
turn it on and let it go no talk no ads,0
spotify changed my whole world after my son told me about it years ago what they have full albums they have albums from the 70s tears were shed as i would have a musical memory do a quick search and bam the best of bread twin sons of different mothers rumours --it doesnt get any better than this totally worth it people,1
love my morning gospel playlists on my way to and from work,1
i cant even access my playlist without data connection ,0
used to be fine now it wont even show the playpause bar only way to stop my music is to force closed when connect to bluetooth it wont show the song etc it force closes it self almost every other song i can reinstall and itll maybe work for an hour,0
im its great other than the fact that it has ads im good,1
best music  podcast service by far,1
fantastic music app ,1
amazing app on the whole easy to navigate and create playlists a bit buggy though,1
i cant switch genres in my liked songs list anymore,0
i would give the app 5 stars but it still has a lot of stuttering issues regardless of what network connection im using,0
okay for listening to music but if i am paying to get rid of ads then dont push them on me when i try to listen to a podcast customer service is mediocre,0
i cant pick a song in the album that i like when i play the album another song that doesnt belong in there will play one time it even play song that doesnt belong in the artist i just hope that they return the last version because this update sucks,0
very easy to use although their are some small bugs somthimes,0
the app is great i only hate it when the queuing thing doesnt work,0
great app use it every day,1
great listening    all my old favourites,1
amazing music  podcast app spend about 8 hours a day on it,1
smooth flowing easily find the artist that am looking for,1
would rate better if i could choose the songs id actually want to listen to the xboxtabletweb client are all far better than this junk,0
please provide a feature so that the spotify widget can support transparent settings so that it is tailored to their individual needs thanks,1
the best of its kind smooth ui superd music algorithm i tried the other ones but none came close overall,0
id say a great app but its expensive just to be able to skip or go back which in my case i find it annoying,0
often stops playing stop and play sometimes not available doesnt seem like any one at spotify wants to solve the problem,0
just bring back the shuffle all albums option ,1
app is good buggy sometimes on android,1
using this app with a tablet or pc is decent a few songs then ads but atleast you can choose the song you like to play unlike using a phone it wont give you the song you wanted plus limited skips,0
there are many lengthy ads only 1 short ad will be appreciated,0
love the app listen all day to music a choose easy no cost way to enjoy music you like,1
best music app without lags nice sound quality and with a good price and easy to use,1
works as advertised everything i want and need also love the fact that i dont have to worry about sensorship they dont remove stuff because it goes against mainstream propaganda,1
excellent app ive never not be unable to find a song or album,1
coss battery lasts a little bit longer,0
spotify im really curious what your idea of 30 minutes is cause i feel like im getting an add every ten or whenever i reopen the app i dont mind watching adds its just if your gonna say 30 minutes of free listening give me 30 minutes,0
is anyone else having this issue when i open a playlist i dont get options from where to start when i get those they start playing from the highlights only 6 skips are allowed per hour this isnt spotify lite i didnt happen befor and its not hapening in my tab whats the issue i hope someone can help i dont even know what im doing wrong i have a doubt abt this being lite but i dont think so pls help thank you,0
i love spotify from how i can create multiple playlist for every mood and also listen to playlists that are created by my own favorite artists and the ones created by spotify it is actually fascinating how spotify will go all the way out to find the type of musicgenre you like and start suggesting songs and artists firtst   artist suggestion second  spotify playlist third  flexibility of the app fourth   fair subscription fee i will add another star if a new features is added ,1
horrible uih too much clutter not enough working parts paid for premium still getting ads and cant listen to the downloaded content hard to navigate through the clutter to find what im searching for the app need to be more simplified,0
best music streaming app,1
i love listening to music on spotify,1
great anything u want to hear ads are too loud,0
its difficult to listen to a playlist to go to sleep it continues after the playlist playing popular recommended songs,0
nice app for online music,1
excellent appno crashing and it will play our song from where we had stopped recently,1
awesome but expensive should be 1 payment for membership,0
i love using spotify it has amazing recommendations most of the times and the audio quality it offers is really pleasing i am using the ad free version but it is worth it too 4 stars for the amazing application - 1 star as it sometimes has operating issues it has all types of music and over 1000 of playlists to choose from spotify is crazy good,1
hi the music is good but there are too many ads for premium it says adds will come after 30 minutes but after every 2 songs ads come and its irritating so please remove some ads that is why gave it4 stars,0
good enough,1
overall a pretty horrible experience trying to listen to anything without being interrupted with commercials every 5 minutes trying to make it through the podcast is absolutely horrendous im debating uninstalling,0
music quality is best i used ganna and youtube premium also,1
pretty good experience for the past few years lately the app has been crashing bad and suddenly which isnt ideal hopefully something changes soon,0
i love the selection of songs available ive been using spotify for the past few years and i still love it,1
absolutely fine,1
cool songs,1
this app is not working smoothly,0
im sry but im just annoyed it wont play my favorite song for me  im trying another app because this is only good for playlists bye,0
works for the most part but often doesnt update podcasts or claims offline when connected to the internet update 4112022 somehow it works even less now after this last update now in the middle of podcasts it just randomly stops,0
listen to your music faster instead of going to listen to your music on youtube go to spotify,0
can you update,1
excellent for music discovering new music and podcasts all in good quality,1
continous music i dont know why i didnt discover this app earlier,0
its a very good musical app i have learn so much about good music,1
i really hate how it adds extra songs to your playlists i have to constantly go through and take them all off i make my playlists how i like them and dont need your input also the ads are far too loud why are that so much louder than the music i have my music quite quiet when using headphones but the ads pop up and i have to take my headphones off because it hurts my ears,0
good selection of music,1
good,1
love spotify honestly i pay for the premium so no ads but even without premium its amazing ,1
if youre going to keep deleting jre episodes then i will be canceling my subscription joe is an important voice in todays silence or cancel culture please do not bend to a few big mouths we support rogan,0
i am very very happy with this and spotify i just suggest add more podcast and others,1
joe roganyou need a new venue i will miss your show but i will not be back to spotywifi the app interface is bullshet you are losing audience because spotywifi cant seem get thier krap together,0
love the music options,1
app is good when it works i store my library on an external sd card which has caused a few problems one of which is extremely infuriating when choosing where to store my library i see three sd card options which do i choose and recently spotify has decided to randomly un-download my entire library 3x as someone who has limited wifi data usage these extra 15gigs arent something i consider to be acceptable considering i pay for this service im quite disappointed in the quality,0
it is easy to get on this app and alot of music that i like it works real good no problems,1
annoying upgrade popup even when i have not opened the app would like to keep but to annoying,0
here listen to new rammstein album but instead of playing songs from that album we will also play random other songs useless app in non premium mode,0
stop adding songs to the playlist i create if i wanted to listen to that music i would have played a list that would have me discover songs i created my own playlist so i dont have to use my skips looking for a song i want very disappointing the app would be great if this was fixed dont wast your time getting frustratedplease fix this,0
i use this app a lot i already rated it and i had a problem with ads repeatimg previously that issue isnt that bad anymore but the app keeps bugging out i hit play and it starts playing but the app acts like it isnt so there isnt anyway to pause it unless i force the app ro stop same issue accors where the app constantly stops playing and can only be fixed by force closing fix this i will give 5 stars,0
cuts out all the time for no reason some times the player doesnt show up and you have to close the app completely to get it back after an add you have to reset it back to full screen,0
i would give it 5 stars but for it stops playing unless my phone is always open to main menu seems to be working now,0
i absolutely love spotify i can create playlist that suit my every mood,1
i really enjoy the scope of music thats available if you can think of if they have it ths one thing that rubbed me wrong was when i set this up i wanted the family plan i was unable to set up my wife with spotify and i hear about it from time to time i shouldnt have to tell you about it here but i couldnt get anyone to help with the setup,1
wonderful i am gratefule,1
so many ads after the latest update it make me wanna uninstall it,0
its really simple to use and finding what i want to listen to is a breeze,1
ive been a premium subscriber since 2020 and the app was amazing until the last update what happened to the preview song feature it used to be so convenient clicking the side of the song that ive searched to hear a bit out of it now i need to guess if the piece that i want to add to my playlist is the one i wanted or go to youtube to be sure please bring it back,0
good app but it doesnt allow users to search the song by saying it or by buzzing or by other means also it,0
possiblity the worst user experience ever if like me you are a random dipper and want to listen to an albumsingle from your past and not interested in making playlists etc then preserve your sanity and find another method i normally want to listen to music to relax in the short perios of time i get free unfortunately this is typically a failure using the mobile app which ends up in stress and disappointment,0
a very nice app has many songs and playlists also has data data saving options,1
never an issue and if one comes up its dealt with very satisfying app ive been using for years love it 1010 definitely reccomend,0
love this app i love controlling my tv its just frustrating sometimes to edit playlist from the phone,0
this is the best place you can ever get to get music you like and enjoy,1
it is super amazing to hear music in recomend 100,1
ive had my spotify account for yonks and used it extensively for business and pleasure alike but lately the application has been crapping out so badly ive started looking into more reliable alternatives technical issues are more or less constant both on laptop and smartphone the app fails to open the last searches go missing there are pointless automatic reinstalments you name it a word of advice youre in a heavily saturated marketplace this is not the moment to get too comfortable,0
constant updates that never improve the failure of playing songspodcastsetc consecutively without interruption after 8 or 9 minutes already tried all hints from the support and google regarding this issue nothing works very disappointing for a paid application,0
good choice of songs,1
loving the endless access to the music the options to enhance it is always a bonus to have access to what can inspire isnt that what music is for thats a good thing yeah its where we want to go yeah loving it,1
i like being able to mark my favorite selections,1
recomendations are based on geolocation and not from the songs i liked ui awful navigation,0
pairs with the truck before start  drives,0
app has had alot of problems in the last couple of months keeps glitching and wont play songspodcast not worth paying for until its fixed,0
i think it sucks we have to pay for no ads but other than that i love it ,1
i absolutely love listening to all my podcasts on spotify,1
this app is terrible for free users honestly i can end it all here for free users you cant freely choose the songs you want to listen too not skip not even and there will be an ad every 2-3 songs in that said there is still a wide range of music available i like its recommendation algorithms so overall its still a very solid app but only if you want to buy premium,0
great app this is one music streaming app that i always come back to its a phenomenal deal for the quality and amount of content,1
app is good but now sharing in snap chat is glitchy plz fix it ,0
stuck on loading screen,0
this app has major link and playback issues i use it on android os12 firstly you cannot play a direct song that is shared to you via social media when you press the green play button to the bottom right of the song title the app simply ignores it and plays whatever it wants from random artists if you enter your savedplaylist the same thing happens this is very biased copyright playback since the specific artists on spotify cannot get there own music played per share fix it,0
a lot better than what i call the first and second generation spotify 3rd generation busen,1
like the app but i dont like is the dumb advertisement,0
absolutely splendid lyrics an equalizer a huge library of songs and soundtracks always has just what im searching for and great daily playlists too  edit so ive come to the realization that id really love one more thing added  please allow sound recording when screen recording in the app just like youtube music would be a huge huge one if you could do that,1
i dont even think i need to describe why im giving the app 1 star--literally see all the recent reviews so disappointing developers please realize that this may be a big company but youre losing users in droves for how glitchy the app has become how do you think anyone will be able to keep their jobs if spotify stops bringing in a massive amount of their revenue idk asking for a friend,0
my podcast stops playing after 5 minutes and when i hit play it continues to stop im switching to stitcher,0
this new update is sooo bad i miss the old version plus the old version let you choose the songs this new update is trash you have to get premium to at least have it better but not good please bring back the old version ,0
great app i love when i play my favorite album from dynamo y13 it plays all the songs back to back,1
i enjoy listening to various talented artists thank you ,1
cool fine tunes every time everywhere,1
all good to easy spotify rocks,1
its the best out there but but ive seen that other accounts have this lyrics feature that i dont have on my account it works on my computer but it doesnt on my phone,0
simply outstanding collection of song,1
songs have been glitching and its only been doing so for last few days i have the songs either downloaded or im on wifi so not sure why its been happening,0
easy to use and has all the songs i want,1
im loving every single feature of the app,1
use to have beats that then turned in apple musicwhich did not like at all found out about spotify and do not regret getting it,1
i love it guys every day listeningonly i think disadvantage is that not possible single song dowoad but full set it tracks at least i havent found this option ,0
edit changing my review from 5 star to 2 star there are tons of fake bot playlists on spotify and there is no way to report them one of my heavy metal tracks got randomly added to an edm playlist despite not pitching there extremely fishy probably trying to tempt me into purchasing streams after i saw the amount of increase in streams but it just hurts an artists credibility spotify needs to allow us to report fake playlists this drama of buying streams needs to end,0
spotify is good to all songs album music and playlist,1
sometimes on the app it will not let you remove songs from your created playlist other than that its great,1
good,1
unable to login stuck in an endless loop between emails and app uninstalled,0
at first i thought this app was good but when i create playlist suggested songs just pop in and plays songs i dont even know i am tired of this,0
great app to listen to your music all i need to say,1
spotify is amazing but cant download,0
enjoying spotify music very much the app works better this time around and has excellent sound quality the music that is offered is extensive and i enjoy listening to a wide variety of options like that i can listen to my music on all of my devices anywhere,1
they want to make their podcasts exclusive which forces you to use the spotify app instead of your favorite podcast app you may have been using for years then they give you this garbage half baked tacked on podcast section its so terrible especially for such a big company are they not capable to do a little market research and see what makes the many best podcasts apps the best then they can add many of those standard awesome features to their mess get with the program spotify,0
useful app,1
very amazing app i have premium,1
spotify thank you your 1,1
poor playlists repeating the same songs over and over premium has limited options car mode and regular mode are skewed just tired of spotifywe need a better streaming service that spotify and pandora,0
works perfect after last update,1
good range of music,1
verrrrrrrrrrry good app i found my favorite songs incredible,1
app doesnt find nearby devices making it pretty much useless unless you only listen on your phone,0
the app keeps glitching music stops on its own display bar disappears starting to be very stressful,0
great people great app true platform for sharing free music and ideas,1
i like finding the music i like im only kinda upset that knife in my back by alec benjamin isnt on here,0
i pay for spotify premium now because i dont like ads but amazon music was absolutely atrocious when it came to podcasts i have had zero issues with spotify at anytime for anything,0
if i search for a song it plays a totally different one but is showing the image and description of the one i wanted really,1
worst music app after every single song they give advertisingresso is better than this,0
music stops playing mid-song fix this please i pay money for this app,0
its a good app and has lots of the older music that you sometimes cant even find on youtube however my main issue is that it adds songs to your playlists for you with no warning ill play a playlist that ive made sure is clean christian family and a song will pop up that is really gross screwed up and has way to much profanity for me to be able to listen to it i would like it if this autoadd feature was removed or had a way to disable it in settings,0
latest update broke something app randomly stops playing when screen is off and other weird behaviour like the player controls not showing in the app or in the notification drawer,0
excellent i like it very much its refreshing for me for i got my music that i want to hear to glorify god  im tuning in christian music godbless to all,1
lets try this for a 3rd time mabey they wont delete it this time its a bad app that constantly crashes and freezes would not recommend,0
connected to wifi cant search anything,0
fantastic works well with an alexa which was not very compatible with apple users can interact and share content quite easily,1
can someone explain why am i not getting the lyrics with songs ive reinstalled it many times  ,0
very good music quality,1
great,1
at the time of writing this im listening to spotify or rather i would be if it werent for the ads currently on ad number 7 in a row this is ridiculous i can live with 2 ads but recently its gone up to 3-7 between songs obviously this is to push their subscription based services but if thats the way they go about trying to convince me id rather just use a different platform,0
lots of ads,0
stop begging for permissions every time i open app i need to deny bluetooth while listening trough bluetooth headphones also free experience is 1 in other words listen to constant ads intermixed with couple of songs honestly makes me too annoyed to even consider premium and rather go amazon or google music,0
ive been listening to spotify for a few years now the look has changed l like lt i can find the songs that i like and change them when i like,1
awesome best music provider in my opinion plus if you do the the surveys you could win premium which i did and its great 1010,1
my wifi and data are fine but spotify has been choppy loading songs lately and stops intermittently other people seem to be having this problem too ive uninstalled and reinstalled no help,0
latest update has removed a lot of functionality - can no longer access the song playing in the play list so cannot stop shuffle very frustrating and disappointing,0
cant use the song feature help me please,0
its not a music app this is a ads app ad promotion is over plss reduce the ads but other wise good,0
trash login system  whenever i try logging into some other device through my mobile numberthe otp never arrives      stop begging for premium,0
has what i want,1
i used to like spotify since they picked the wrong side of politics intentionally and dont want to correct there mistakes i dont even want there music or service for free no one deserves to have a platform to spread misinformation thats how people go down the wrong path thats how a company will end it self it not only about the quality of the music its also about what they spend there ad money on putting a label saying this is misinformation doesnt cut it for me,0
i thought at first wow what an amazing app so much better than yt music but oh wait this morning i went into the app and it said your 14 day free trail has stopped what i dont even have premuim now it has ditched all its good functions - example - only 6 skips per hour can only play specific songs the dumbest app ever id rather pay for yt premium than use this 0 stars if i could rate it,0
my experience with spotify has been great i love that you can download and listen offline and the amount of content on this music app is quite expansive,1
it tells me 30 mins no ad music and while im working out 10 mins later an adfalse advertising,0
really good i love spotify ,1
youre app keeps stoppingcrashing on my phone the song thats playing doesnt come up anywhere and then it stops mid song 10 minutes later,0
i was satisfied for months but now for whatever reason the app just stops and starts randomly it also sometimes doesnt show the correct pod cast thats is currently playing at the bottom of the screen,0
i love this app but but the new update man ive had this for over a year or two and why cant i preview songs when i am adding them to a playlist what the actually hell ok otherwise 5 stars,0
this is an awesome app its so easy to useive been using this app for a while now but there is one problemwhen u create a playlist they add random songs and play it which sometimes just ruins the vibe,0
hey spotify please make option where users can choose multiple song all at once to add to some list itll be easier please,0
i cant understand this app because im choice another song its come another song its making me mad plx update this app i cant be so relax with this stupid app,0
best music app i have seen,1
premium sucks it wont let me play the songs that i want without shuffling and it doesnt even play the songs from that album,0
i hate putting such a negative review on the app because i truly do enjoy it though recently since ive gotten a new phone ive been having some issues with the music sporadically stopping and when im not using any bluetooth it just stops playing altogether unless i have phone on and on the app please fix these issues,0
i dont really like the update that i cant hear or i cant see the bottn that plays the music shortly i wanted that bcoz its more comfortable and more nice than the new update like you really can hear the music if u dont know the tittle but u know the lyrics u know,1
the controls keep disappearing please fix the bug asap ive been using this app for a while now and pretty much satisfied with it apart from the bug i just mentioned,1
this app sucks how many times i logged in it is going directly to premium page i think my free trial completed and i changed my mail id but it didnt changed and again going to premium page it is our choice if we want to take premium we will purchase youspotify team dont have force us please understand and fix this problem thank you,0
love it wish there was no ads for free though ,0
it annoys me that i cannot properly block remove certain shows from my home page ive tried everything mobile and on pc but nothing seems to work please add an option to customise your home page,0
selection is good queue is cumbersome to use and edit,0
constamtly randomly pauses or doesnt let you press play at all terrible for a paid for service,0
thanks for help last time just something thats been bothering me for a while now  the like system sucks just cuz sokeone downloads an album doesnt mean every song is liked maybe im different from everyone elae but i havent found a album in recent years where i liked all the songs please change the system so the liked songs list isnt filled with songs to skip,0
best streaming service out there,1
worse and worse so many bugs recently that the app is getting to a point where it is unusable why do you keep pushing out these updates without stress testing first your making more work for a team that already cant do their job properly,0
this app has helped me through so much my playlist is almost 69 hours worth of music from all different genres i find tons of new music i enjoy everyday spotify premium isnt very expensive and its totally worth it spotify has quite literally saved my life ,1
buffer quality is good,1
annoying interface and difficult to navigate unfortunately shuffle play is always on even with paid membership,0
amazing app all the music you want to listen to is here best music app so far i got no trouble or problems with this app before you install it theres also ads but not many  1010,1
for the last two months i had more access to things in spotify but now its changed and i kinda hate it now,0
best music app but it crashes way too often and has some bugs like play delays even on a brand new device with 8gb ram please try optimize this,0
fantastic music streaming service i use a family plan premium membership and weve had no difficulties setting up each individual account there is a tremendous amount of music available and i love that you can add your own downloads one thing i would love to see is something similar to youtube music in that when you click on a specific album a short synopsis from that albums wikipedia page shows up and gives you some background information on that specific record add that and its a wrap,1
uninstalled and i will not use it again until spotify stops giving antivaxxers and conspiracy theorists a forum,0
you know why,1
i like spotify and thats my favorite streaming music app but in my country the interface is different from us uk etc this is discrimination for those reason i will give two star now from five stars  which i have rated till now please make spotify interface same for all country  thanks,0
dont download stupid app says im losing followers on my artist profile when i know for a fact due to my self promotions and screenshots from facebook i have been gaining followers adds songs you didnt want to your playlist and the list goes on and on what are you upto spotify you earning so much money that you dont care about your users experience your going to find your going to lose alot of subscribers due to your subpar platform stupid app,0
excellent,1
its legit and awesome  im using samsung galaxy j2 core and i got my premium 3 months add free with 2months free,1
player in the app keep on vanishing please fix this issue asap,0
this is a must have if you enjoy ad free music,0
nice app for listening songs but please make a feature to linten music offline without prenium it also dosent uses your more network than other apps,0
never easier to have my favorite music in one place and quickly accessible let alone new hits podcasts and,0
very fast and accessable,1
no words to say it is awesome but adds are the problems ,0
was a good place for music no longer as it supports a master of disinformation joe rogan im removing this app and as my family is involved in the music scene in louisville we are also asking our musical friends to remove and warn others about your inability to look beyond the money good day sirs good day,0
must include the option of voice search,0
a very good app  recommended to all my friends,1
wasnt sure id like spotify right away discovered a good selection the playlist are easy to make in no time had 3 made one for work one for chilling an one for lets f-n rock my favorite,0
generally like this app especially with premium but without it is outrageous 6 ads in a row all unskippable thanks for the music,1
music podcasts life at ur fingertips control from your phone send to bluetooth chromecast playstation etc,0
for some reason since the beginning of april occasionally the player wont sync up with the app and while i can select items to play it wont let me open up the player so i can see my queue pause skip etc i dont know what is causing this bug but i hope it will be fixed soon as it makes the app very difficult to use,0
its great for podcasts,1
its alot here everything i couldnt imagine im so musical,1
spotify plays all of my favorite songs ,1
this app is amazing and its sound quality just wow,1
constantly stops playing except when it keeps playing but doesnt display the song or any way to control it until you kill and reopen it come on spotify there should not be this many issues in an app like this,0
i have been spotify user for about 5 years now i love the application on desktop and web but the mobile app is where it gets the 3 stars car view was a feature that existed up until 2021 where it was ultimately removed in november this was a significant feature for users without the newer car play and android auto this feature single handedly improved safety when driving as the buttons were big enough to press this was not a good change,0
great music collection,1
so many ads if you dont have premium more ad listen time to music listen time update after 2 years of paid usage i like it much more obviously but 120 a year to listen to music back to back is absurd why do more people not have a problem with this im sure a lot do but just tough it through which is what im doing seriously though spotify this is insane were just people wanting to listen to music without the awful ads make it 5 a month of course free would be better 5 is ok,0
one plus 6t bug no longer able to scrub through content as the podcast episode ui doesnt update i can hear the audio but am now unable to use the media controls edit now the play bar at the bottom wto navigate to the song youre playing is missing can you please test some more before releasing updates perhaps,0
removing episodes due to political pressure just downloaded because they werent now im uninstalling,0
this is a waste of time dont download this dumb app its just a waste need data to play music then you need a premium music to play it offline itll need to spend money to buy a premium how sucks just dont download this sucked app,0
very good app but needs premium to get rid of ads,0
just wish you could make a list of artist and it just play,0
new update broke a lot of stuff i wont list it all because the other reviews all do,1
the audio quality is so poor its half of what resso app gives you please improve it,0
100 has everything,1
recent update and its gone from bad to way worse dont get this app if they did it ill fix my review too many issues to mention not happy,0
the app keeps suggesting songs that i have hidden the app desperately needs a dislike button available at all times that will then skip the song no matter what playlist you are listening to the hide song feature is also available only on certain playlists lastly to cancell your subscription you need to login on a web browser then confirm your cancellation what feels like 100 times before it finally believes you dont want it anymore,0
spotify in its original format was great even with adsbut thenthey began gradually increasing ad breaks limiting free functions interfering with my personal song playlists by using my analytic info to inexplicably overreach my custom playlists by adding altering deleting or ignoring my numerous attempts at reco be erinh,0
great thats all i say,1
used to be great then someone made a decision to change the look and feel almost weekly im dropping spotify for this reason and going with tidal as my new streaming service their hi-res lossless format is amazing and the cost is just about the same get with the program spotify or users will continue to drop off daily,0
i love this app ive used it everyday for almost 8 years now it has its bugs every so often but it runs smoothly the major of the time abs is well worth the membership,1
this update change the spotify music start app ,0
i filled my life,1
everytime i click a song it goes to a random song,0
the music keeps stopping and i have to unpause it it also freezes a log so i would like you to fix it please i love this app and i dont want to delete it,1
always get ads while listening few songs,0
please fix the error no internet connection i have been trying to logging into my account and it keep saying no internet connection  try again please fix this   even though i am connected to internet,0
i love the music i told my cousin to download it and she did she was so happy now she has it,1
love this app always have since using i pay for the premium but with this new update i am missing songs now nothing is in order my playlist is all shuffled fix this please,0
its really great for creating playlistsblends discovering new artists etc but the frequency of ads is quite a lot,1
this app is great  it has everything from 19 2000this app is great,1
excellent app been using this since 2018 on top of that i love their twitter customer support,1
showing no internet connection even we have the connection on so that makes irritating,0
i joined for the science vs podcast and was looking at setting up an account but am deleting the app due to spotifiys failure to prevent the spread of antiscience and antivax info,0
been listening to spotify for years never have been asked to rate it got a new phone and it wants to know what i think if i didnt like it id be using another platform,0
i have a lovehate relationship with this app i dont mind the ads its the fact that i cant choose what songs i want to listen to anymore i only get previews of the songs i can only get 6 skips per hour i cant do anything i want almosr all the songs i like to listen to are only for premium users you put so many restrictions on us id rather pay for tidal 2022 update switched to youtube music my life is so much better ,0
this is the best music player i have ever had spotify has all the song you like you can put them in your liked category and you you have daily mixes that you will enjoy thats why i love using spotify 5 stars,1
brings in the best music i need to hear,1
love spotify only change id have is to be able to reorder my playlists easily ive added whole albums to my playlist before but dont want them to be all in a row if there was a way to permanently shuffle the list that would be awesome,0
great selection of music,1
its a bliss been using it since forever love you guys,1
very good and easy to use,1
i love all the podcast,1
simple and inviting nothing counter intuitive to confuse anyone who needs a music platform for gen x and before the idea of the latest interfaces is intimidating at the very least youve exceeded greatly though simplicity and by adding nothing superfluous thanks,1
love the capacity to send many attachments at one time,1
it was fine for the first year i had it but now whenever i try to listen to music on it it stops every song around the 11 second mark i have the songs downloaded and everything it shouldnt be my internet connection,0
this app has been great with premium ever since the new lyric update though i cant see the lyrics on my app it works on the web player but not my phone i even got a new phone and have deleted and reinstalled the app several times to fix it but it just wont work and its super frustrating i just wanted to be able to listen to my music and sing along does anyone else have this problem other than that its great,0
it is very good app for listen to music,1
if you dont have spotify premium then the adsssss are like more than the songs in play list basically its a paid app only,0
i bought 1 day premium and downloded some songs but when my premium ended all songs that i already downloded were gone and when i want to buy 1 day premium again spotify always error,0
i love spotify makes it easier for me to explore a variety of music plus the ads arent much   ,0
saying enjoy 30 min of uninterrupted music but ad is loading after every 10 min better switch to gaana,0
trash constant glitches algorithm for suggestion is a joke,0
all and different musiclove it,1
this issue has been resolved and spotify now plays the correct album material when you search for john mellencamps new album strictly a one-eyed jack it comes up and when you hit the  button spotify plays pink house from his uh-0h album,1
stop adding songs to my playlist,0
love it,1
too much ads dont tell me to switch to premium dont have a card for it,0
ive had spotify for about 5 years now and im a premium user i love the sound quality and the music they put on here the only problem which is why im give 4 stars is that it keeps glitching when im skipping songs it will either not play or keep going to the song previous or just skip 3 songs over other then that great app,0
this app is very good ,1
great app very cool easy to use and has every song would use 100,1
too much a adds,0
waaayyy too many ads recently like every two songs,0
excellent app live spotify,1
im putting the only music i like on a playlist and then i really hate that it puts other random music that i dont want,0
recent update makes audio crash in middle of track also theres no play bar to pause or skip please fix soon,0
i find it ridiculous how some features that should be basic and that all should have are behind monthly payment i guess the app works for now at least well if you people at spotify would care about users more than money then i would honestly enjoy the app,1
absolutely invaluable where else can you have at your finger tips a world of music pod casts and more absolutely invaluable ,1
very good music app by far the best the only downside is without premium it wouldnt be as good,1
amazing music app,1
i unninstalled and tried to download it again but it gets stuck on 72,0
i want my green hearts back,1
every song i search it will come and the sound is amazing thank you for this app,1
i cant help but not listen thank you spotify,1
ok has a good selection of songs but playlists are always on shuffle and when i click on one sing it plays another used to be awesome now its decent,1
so many issues so so many music often stops when screen goes off no controls for music since latest update so can pick a song but thats it no pause skip etc at least three times a day says im not online despite being connected to wifi in my own house honestly if there was a better option id get rid various issues have been present for last few years tbh the not recognising being connected to wifi has been going on for years now just awful,0
ive been using spotify since i first started using a phone i can bear with the ads and everything but for some reason recently the music would just stop when i went to other apps and id have to start the song from the beginning again it happened a couple times and i thought that its okay but its been happening so much recently its really getting on my nerves,0
a option should be there when we search songs in search bar there is no option to add sonfs directly from there into a playlist,0
currently playing and media controls keep dissappearing for at least 2 weeks,0
it is money every where  not what you can control so useless app,0
keeps my playlist for free thanks spotify clash on man,1
spotify is a great app it is so awesome has all the songs u need but sometimes it lags,1
this is a really good app music quality is great the only reason i gave it 3 stars is because you need to pay to listen to music off-line and on top of that you need to pay for it its 1299 and even though its cheap at first it will cost you more over time id love if there was a longer free trial for around 3 months or it can depend on what subscription you want to buy,1
it made me have to log back in and now if wont let me log back in,0
the horror show by khooni monday is the best podcast of this app and also the app is ,1
love the app but unfortunately they removed the enhanced feature from liked songs its available on playlists for me i like to just add songs into liked and i loved the feature it allows me to discover a lot of songs right up my alley hope its restored will change to five stars once its there again,1
playback screen freezing it shows you a different song other than the one youre actually playing,0
i like the appi like the different selections just improve the sound quality some days you can really hear the distortion takes too long to load up when it takes more than 5 minutes thats not good have to turn it off and on off and on,0
its been running like garbage lately was waiting to see if the problem would go away but it has not,0
too many ads i rarely use spotify anymore cause the format is annoying and ads,0
spotify is my companion whilst i sew it helps me to focus and enhances my mood,1
this app is the best app i ever used to listen to music i cant remember when i had a problem with this app and im on a fixed income and they have been very nice and generous and allowed me to pay my account a little late so i would recommend this app to everyone you have to at least try it it cost you nothing and you get any song you may want to hear so give it a try today and speak about your experience with spotify music app,1
group session cant work properly,0
the best application i have tried in my life and i advise everyone to try it and i like the quality and purity of the sound and if there were 5 additional stars my rating for it would have increased as well in the end i would like to say vesca barsa vesca catalunya,1
frequent updates still havent fixed my most common problems now whenever i connect to something via bluetooth it automatically deletes my queue why,0
more than not the music player doesnt load never used to do this not sure if it was a glitch in the last update but now i have to restart the app almost every time i open it to get it to load properly,0
im only trying to pick a song and while i press it play its picks a suggested song instead of a song that i was trying to play and i keep on having to do it over and over again and it just keeps on putting a suggested song instead of a song that i already picked so im leaving a bad review cause this sucks youtube music is better,0
somethings wrongif im not using my phone the music stops playing i have to restart my phone to get it to stop playing after it disconnects from the bluetooth everything was perfect before this,0
when i saw spotify stand up and have a backbone against the spread of misinformation  and actually let neil young hit the road like he deserved  i knew this was a company worthy of my hard-earned money  as long as they keep up the great service which blows away youtube music  and stays in their lane and works for the people  i will be a lifetime customer ,1
great selection worth subscribing whole family enjoys having their favs playlists,1
i dont like the new update because i cant skip songs i cant drag in timestamps and this app suddenly add songs that i didnt put in my playlist,1
it is very good it lets me pick my music,1
desktop app is great but the mobile app is so infuriating to navigate,0
more ads than options keeps clinching so my podcasts close after a few minutes of playing,0
most of the time its an awesome app great music and podcasts occasionally more often now than before the option to pause skip or play disappears and you have to restart the app or your phone to be able to stoppauseskip the song or podcasts,0
the player and widget in the spotify app is now dissapearing in app or becoming unresponsive widget since updating i am using a samsung note 10 5g running ui 41 latest os,0
i find it to be very user friendly,1
customer service for such a large company should not be down also the fact that youre unable to report disinformation taking place on podcast is unacceptable for such a large platform,0
love just about everything about this app the music selection ability to share and discover new music its absolutely wonderful,1
it is an awesome station and gives you good music clarity clarity and i love it,1
very good music very reliable service i enjoyed very much,1
perfect for listening to music with lots of features,1
spotify is affordable and has all the music you could wantbut my god is this thing slooooooooow the app frequently decides to close completely and getting it to start takes forever you could literally wait a minute before it loads and allows you to play music it boggles the mind that a company this big can get things so utterly wrong ,0
good app,1
i love this app soo much its my daily dose and i hope its yours too,1
i was finally able to get spotify premium gift cards back in january so it has been the best music app since then at least where i am at in my interestes right now and i was wondering if you guys at spotify could make it possible for us out here to be able to rate the songs like the music app jango does,1
also a long time user of this app and have generally been very happy - however since the last update the app has been crashing frequently or playing music without the controlshuffle bar option at the bottom of the app,0
app is very good just add one thing in the next update and that is please add the feature to make the playlist of liked songs so that we can share our liked songs playlist to our loved ones really looking forward for that thank you,1
the songs are amazing  ,1
commercials for free account are too long im cheap but cant stand these ads i can create a playlist on youtube and get through commercials in 10 seconds not gonna mess with this,0
i love having instant access to music all day everyday no matter what my mood is,1
love  my only app for music and podcasts,1
songs and lyrics are available at all times listening to music by all songs available in shuffle mode,1
ive been a fan of spotify for many years now  will continue to enjoy your service thank you so much ,1
fantastic music service been a user for probably 8 years now and have always put the user first new integrations are always a benefit and havent had any issues,1
exprience was good,1
guess you didnt want my honest review thanks for deleting you creeps this app would be fine if it werent for the inescapable unpredictable ads i listen to music to calm down and this app causes more distress than its worth at least on youtube i can listen to the songs i want and can skip ads,0
i too experience the bug which causes the playback to stop when the screen is off and hides the control bar in the app,0
it dont turn off when i go to different apps,1
after 4 years of being a premium member i can say this is probably the worst music app on the market trying to use this offline is such a pain since offline play is a premium only feature i would expect it to work but it just doesnt 50 of the time downloaded podcasts take years to load unless youre specifically in offline mode download buttons load indefinitely spotify crashes while playing in the background often etc etc wish i could find an alternative,0
i have premium but if you dont have it the ads are way too many and way too often,0
can start playing music but the bar containing the controls does not appear constant problem since the last update,1
good for listening music i dont think after i am installing this app then i saw this advertisement so i say to me lets see what is in this app then i download and now daily listen music tnx for this app,0
too many adds ridiculous,0
premium user every update the bugs get worse and worse i know bugs are bound to happen but now the app crashes constantly the sleep timer on podcasts is broken and will not aways work as in i have set the sleep timer set and i wake up with a podcast playing its an amazing app when it works well but i cant go a day after this update without a frustrating bug the last updates yielded bugs once a week what did you guys do with the last update that makes the app terrible,0
unable to listen to a podcast with speed higher than 10x in a browser without installing this unnecessary app and creating yet another account i wont be creating that so for me it is a totally useless service and they should follow the netflix path,0
overall terrible experience you cant even find the single song you want to listen to you have to shuffle through songs you dont like until you get the one song that you were trying to listen to,0
it is the wonderfull app because i like to hear music,1
amazing app for music,1
good app but fix your bugs they are too many,0
good selection of songs and playlist is easy,1
i love the discovery of new music especially the new technoelectronic composers free with ads is great for now that is okay i am pleased spotify can offer the experience of music i enjoy  listen to every day a subscriber probably down the road a bit i am patrick doing the rating marte is my wife 46 years together,1
horrible always crashes takes 2-10 minutes to load even when in offline mode have to clear chache daily to get the app working shuffle feature will repeat the random engine seed giving the same random order of songs,0
newest update is awful - app reset and closes when changing songs,0
it doesnt let me play the song i want  it just shuffles to a diffrent sobg please change this,0
this is one of the top 3 best music apps just wish there were less ads,1
too many ads on podcasts with spotify premium,0
annoying nag for extra unnecessary bluetooth permissions every time you open the app the answer is no and no means no respect that and stop asking,0
i like the fact that you can find so much music but there is sooo much to dislike like the fact that i cant choose what to listen to and every thing is shuffled and i cant listen to whatever i want and if i put one music in a playlist to listen to it they add music out of no where its annoying,0
best but worst app i cant play the liked songs this shows everytime no internet connection that feels bad,0
picking a controversial character over a musician is a big mistake made my choice between this and youtube music easy bye,0
bro give me back the thing to hear a song before i put it in my playlist ,0
the app crashes and is slow on sooo many ocassions  for a tech giant their main product kind of sucks now,0
its a good application,1
you should be able to make and sort a playist however you want,0
never had any issues until nowconstantly glitching music stops playing even with the app open the playpause buttons disappears this has put a damper on my listening experience needs an update asap,0
love finding music and podcasts im looking for on the whole a good experience,1
i always have problems when i try to pay for premium mini it says unable to connect even when my internet is stable ive tried changing my data multiple times please fix this,0
the android auto interface needed the ability to manually search as googles voice control often fails,0
this is great song what i love my popular song and no more pause anymore i like it,1
eh its k but im sick of the random suggested songs in my playlist it just makes me irritated and the songs arent even my tastesmall amount of skips i cant repeat the song even if i can it just runs out of skips ive only been using it a few months and im sick of this,0
recent update broke the app active playing bar vanishes frequently music jitters and stops songs disappear from my library etc etc and then they have the guts to ask me to rate them well here i am,0
every update requires that i reinstall the app in order for it to work properly and it will mess up any alarms linked to the app stop making things that already work worse,0
ive used this app for almost 5 years now and honestly i wont ever stop using it i love that spotify makes playlist thats fully dedicated to you as an individual i love the dj feature it so fun thank you spotify for amazing 5 years ,1
i pay for premium but man every update on samsung 21 plus this app crashes loader  widget doesnt work properly and completely becomes useless uninstalled and reinstalled and still same issues please work on galaxy 21 updates devs,0
i love the podcast and i love music thank you for the people that make the playlist and other stuff that i like on spotify,1
its pretty cool i like it but too much ads and lyrics in songs are wrong but still i like it,1
its alright without premium but its awesome with premium,1
use it on a daily basis and to be honest dont think after using it i could live without it music is my thing and what i use it for mostly obviously but gotta whack a few podcasts on now and again like true crime or drnosleep or the jack pod but best thing iv ever downloaded and wont ever have a phone without it again unless for some reason they stop the app  now for a 2 hour drive  alexa play spotify ,1
took away car mode without a suitable replacement,0
works well ads can be annoying but otherwise nice,1
first you could choose songs from between your playlist and put your favourite songs but now you have to wait for you to listen to that song its not how it used to be alot more things i would like to tell you but i wont ill let the rating decide my experience,0
has ads sometimes they get too much but it is very easy to use and has all my favourite songs a thing that i love is if i dont remember the name of song i simply search the lyrics and the song shows up also i love the personalized playlists,1
trash app cant even log in via fb account,0
love spotify ive used it for years you can make your own playlists the app recommends new music for you based on what you already listen to it also makes mixes for you based on what youve been listening to recently its the only music app i use and recommend it to everyone i know,1
i love the fact that there is roughly 1300 different music genres world wide and that because of apps like this its all accessible to everyone and anyone who wants to listen beautiful  ,1
the ads come too frequently and very repetitive the ads keep interrupting like after every song there will be an ad longer than a song other than this its a nice app,0
spotify fix your bugs and glitches i love this app but lately ive to uninstall and reinstall the app multiple times but the songs still shuffle randomly the song will play for about 18s then stop playing sound while the song is still going on i go to skip a song and it will go forward and couple songs then go back songs i cant play what i want,0
ive been using spotify for years best music app out there,1
amazing,1
i really like spotify i have a problem why do you guys only allow tablets to have no ads even if they dont have spotify premium,0
you are good in musicyou know music and you provide music for the best listeners,1
i use to love spotify i enjoy listening to podcasts but lately the app had been acting up i will stop out of nowhere or it will say that it is playing when it isnt  im thinking of unsubscribing but i have hope this will be fix ,0
was originally 5 star never had any problems until this past update so annoyed that i had to drop it down 2 stars might even go lower if the issues persist app keeps crashing doesnt show your song is playing unless you restart the app entirely any news on a fix or are we sol,0
they have all the podcast i listen too and all the music i look up my only complaint is that when you put it on shuffle like with your liked songs it plays the same songs all the time,0
one of my biggest critiques would be the song shuffling i have over 1000 songs why would you keep playing the 10-15 consistently ,0
adds adds adds  i dont like it  i avoid  but adds likes me   i cant avoid ,1
its awesome i can find all my favorites on it,1
its a really good app for music lovers  you should try it now highly recommended try it out,1
this app is like a cd walkman from way back when it skips so much skipping only seems to happen when my phone is locked sort it out spotify  since last update also now the now playing thing is missing so i cant skip songs only have playlist view ,0
this app is brilliant every single song is here,1
all my downloaded songs are gone somehow now im unable to play offline worst experience ever,0
would be the best app ever if there werent so many glitches,0
it has so much music great variety and i use it all the time i love spotify its awesome,1
i used to love learning about artists via spotify using the about section why in gods name are you letting bands and artists write their own about section they write in a form of language less comprehensive and more cringeworthy than most corporate branding reserved for enterprise technology companies rovitivo does a good objective job stick with them they have the collective audience in mind,0
nice appbut when i try to play a song thats in a playlist all the songs come up and i cant hear the song that i chosei will rate this a 45 out if 5,0
lately the app just does its own thing it plays music without the option to stop skip image to actually switch off the phone completely to stop playing dropped to 2 now after all the years it should improve and not get worst 1st review no reply ever receive to my query changed my review down to 3 i have searched to find a solution and go through all settings but i can not get to car view mode have reinstalled app but when i press car setting nothing happens,0
songs are great but after a while the audio started glitching audio sounds like a scratched record i had to uninstall it a reinstall it for it to work right,0
new update pauses songs while listening on mobile and desktop for no reason on wifi as well as data mode doesnt matter at what quality,0
app keeps randomly shutting down on me lately,0
we have family premium and normally love spotify but it can be super annoying when im listening to music on my pc or something and use my phone to control it it keeps disconnecting from the device so i have to keep reconnecting it over and over when i change songs it wont just let me change song i have to keep going in and out of the app so it changes,0
pretty good just not all songs i look for i find,1
now playing bar keeps disappearing,0
oh my goodness it is really nice cz you get every music you want ,1
the new update just doesnt work that great it seems to conflict with a bunch of things and doesnt function well like i cant even see what im playing boo,0
the control bar has dissappeared songs start and stop cannot move between songs will be ceasing subscriptionif this continues,0
current version doesnt show up in the notification bar or on the lock screen if i want to know what songs playing or change the track i have to open my phone and go all the way into the app ,0
the music is nice but theres actually less music on this service because of how firm and proud they are about their official stance of loving to spread harmful misinformation for profit,0
idk if its an update but i cant choose a song from my playlistit needs to be shuffled so i cant play the song that i want to listen toand every two songs there will a an ads which is pretty annoying tbhi would prefer the last versionis there a way to do that spotify is confusing me rn,0
the amount of bugs in the current version needs to be fixed its been a few days of people reporting the app continuously playing or not being able to access the player people pay for premium you should be able to get a functional app within a week,0
ive had to uninstall spotify as this is the only solution ive found to stop the app opening all my audio files even though ive never given permission i cant even listen to email audio files as spotify opens them but is unable to playback please fix this,0
i want free speachnot censorship by big tech a-holes keep your app and has-been pop stars,1
why just you dont play tge song i want to hear evrytime i look for a specific song i have to hear some other irrelevant playlist,0
whats app with the sudden change now i cant even play next song and i cant play the song i want i have to shuffle and i have to shuffle about 6 times so as to find the song i want and i cant repeat it now its useless gonna delete this app im going to use boomplay its better,0
lovely app that curates playlists for you based on what you listento the most also finds similar artists and music that you might like and recommend it to you you can find any song on this app if ypu love music go for it,1
5 stars until most recent update last update has changed app management in a fundamental way and is almost unusable now current played track and controls have disappeared sets my podcast playlist back to first episode on list tracks play over one another please address this issue back to 5 stars seem to have gotten it sorted,0
spotify asking me to give them 5 star rating personally i think they are equivalent to i-heart pandora and the rest they are all pretty good,1
new update sucks randomly pauses music when the phone is locked plays without showing a control bar and the only way to stop it is to close the app its been extremely annoying especially knowing how good it worked before,0
i have no problems with it and they have all the music ive been looking for,1
music listening  has never been better  spotify algorithm seems to know what i like even without me knowing  great  but my biggest gripe is the fact they i cant access my favourite podcasts here in uganda  yet that was the single most important reason i switched from tidal  ,0
allow bluetooth allow bluetooth allow bluetooth allow bluetooth allow bluetooth evertime i open the app omg fix it already,0
it just stops all the time now there used to be a banner at the bottom of whats being played so you can rewind or fast forward and its gone now it wont let you listen to the next episode of the podcast on several different ones what changed it sucks now,0
love it so far i can type in artist and fet all their songs i love,1
downloaded playlist and titles often wont load in in offline mode thats incredibly frustrating otherwise its okey working minor bugs and crashes,0
link expired  why do i have to log in on to my account everyday and it doesnt allow me to log in i put in my passwords and username but it doesnt  i have lost all my downloads many times,0
if i even try to play a song that i want to play it plays another one i try this over and over again but the song i want to play never plays,0
this app is amazing and i recommend it to all music lovers u can find any song you want thank you,1
you have to pay to skip songs,0
samsung s21 ultra south africa shuffle keeps turning on,0
if you x out of the music its still plays and when you turn off the device,0
i had downloaded spotify on my phone a few weeks ago i love listening to my favorite songs on here when i dont have nothing else to do i highly recommend it,1
one suggestion add shuffle and repeat buttons to the mini player in lock screen,0
the ever increasing volume of identical ads and trailers drives me in sane,1
lacking in podcast side of it they keep wanting to buy up the rights to podcast but put no money into the app to support them i live in a rural area and the podcast dont auto download the new episode for offline listening the music side is spot on,0
i love the app and just how free to be yourself it is but i use premium because there were so many adds even during 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening also lately songs are being taken off for whatever reason,0
i love being able listen anything i want to,1
maybe its just my phone but the app gets worse with every update - lost the ability to connect to head unit spotify function - playing often keeps going after bluetooth disconnect - loadings are significantly longer now on mobile internet while the signal is perfect - the player bar is often missing while music is being played on the speaker - sometimes it gets completely bugged and unusable,0
its a good music app until you have a premium subscription,1
trash there are so many other better streaming services,0
i cant open my spotify it only shows the logo once i click the app its almost a week now i hope this will get fixed,0
i give five star  amazing app music  quality very good and,1
not perfect like all things but positivity makes best keep getting better spotify i thinked it would be better if i was just honest and said what i thinked preety good app in general,1
ive been using spotify for years and its only gotten better best music app,0
i cant seem to delete strange albums i find in my library that i didnt even put in the list spotify just keeps recommending me stuff i wouldnt normally listen to and put it in my library without my permission,1
i dont like how it can turn on by itself when i try to listen to video on my car and it will start running not a good thing needs to be delt with soon,0
no doubt a great collection of music at your feet but why doesnt the app just keep playing stream on and dont stop,1
good,1
would do 5 stars but a while after being set into offline mode the app gets wonky with playlist and options for songs,1
stable and easy to use with a vast library of music across multiple genres as well as many of the more popular podcasts a very useful feature is the ability to toggle between 3 levels of quality which directly impacts the storage space used for downloads overall i am pleased so far with the value i am getting,1
recent update has made the play bar non-existant and doesnt always populate have deleted re-installed cleared cache and issues persists,0
this app plays so many great songs and albums of all different types from reggae rock soul mellow oldies rap heavy metal hip-hop new artists acoustic and on and on you can pick and choose them yourself and its free but theres ads if you get premium then you dont have to deal with that annoyance and interruption of music but it will cost you on a monthly basis you can also listen to the music with the songs  lyrics which is a great feature so you can sing along,1
the best so far after my experience using other apps like deezer,1
this app is amazing i love it so much and definitely recommend it,1
constant pop asks for bluetooth permission neither option does anything happens while adding songs to playlists or when opening the app,0
it has been my go to music app for years and ive tried many i love all the playlists and suggestions using your music tastes spotify createsprovides its legit i love it plain and simple i wish theyd have a few more playlists though and the music would play louder and the sound quality was even further improved but its still the best music app out there especially if you want to discover new bands and songs 5 stars for sure i highly recommend you give it a shot if you never have,1
thank you for the opportunity to hear my old tracks and remember the good old days,1
spotify is literally the best streaming music service right now my only suggestion would be start offering high fidelity quality inn songs of love this function were added,1
i really like it i just hate that i cant find out how to delete podcasts on it,1
awesome music to kickback  vibe with when your all stressed out and feel like your falling on deaf ears as you cant argue with stupud just sayinglol,1
great but the 30 minutes of ad free listening isnt 30 min its like 20,0
i use this app every day numerous times per day this current version doesnt turn off when disconnecting from bluetooth doesnt display a playstop button and randomly stops playing songs very broken compared to last update,0
1 advertisement after 2 songjust waste of timenever installing it again,0
constant changes to the ui which do nothing to improve the actual app it is now so incredibly bloated and slow that it sometimes takes 15 seconds to load even if its already running there are many times where i cannot access my music or podcasts without shutting the app completely and reopening it they add more ads to the podcasts all the time why am i getting ads i paid for the subscription specifically to avoid ads if it gets much worse i may have to find an alternative,0
most useful appwe can listen whatever we want to listenall types of songs available in this appfabulous ,1
i am fine without needing to pay for music so i get ads but i hate everything else i should not need to pay to see what songs are in a album suggested songs should be optional and skips do not reset at all i have not opened spotify in 5 days so how do i have no skips they have fixed all this so ya use spotify,0
now playing bar and screen have disappeared very unpredictable app,0
i had it 5 stars but it does not play the song i want and this is better than youtube music because you can turn your phone off without paying 10 dollars,1
the stupid shuffle on the playlist is so annoying now its jacked up  ,0
ive had spotify for a few years now love my playlists and the random ones spotify creates for me for ten dollars a month i can listen to whateverwhenever i wantad free love it,0
spotify is ok but it needs some revamping better more coherent yet easy to navigation second spotify needs to fix a bug it has created by making itself the default audio file player of the users phone unresolved complaints have been ongoing since january that the app force opens our private audio files without permission making the phones default audio player rendered inert and you cant fix it without uninstalling spotify spotify does this with permissions set to off,0
app stuck on loading black screen with spotify logo restarted reinstalled no luck using note 20 ultra,0
it is good other than the fact that it adds songs to my playlists when i dont want them please fix also ads were horrid,1
discover weekly has been recommending songs that it has already recommended previously happens occasionally otherwise good job,1
newly buggy it regularly drops off and stops playing and doesnt display the play ribbon regularly so i have no way of pausing fast forwarding or rewinding if i am unhappy i need to click the shuffle button i am also a paying member so i should have full access,0
great service easy to use and tons of music to play,1
not able to buy premium through the app or browser,0
i love it makes my job go by fast,1
im using spotify for years but ever since the recent update im not able to play my liked songs i dont want to shuffle songs and listen i want to listen to only certain songs which i currently like and spotify is not allowing to do so absolutely devastated by this,0
its amazing but not all sorts and forms of songs are available mostly the ones with top views are there not morealso stupid ads,0
its really hard to pick what song you want to hear next and i like the old way,0
i like to hear some podcasts and music when its kinda alonely in my room,0
great i enjoyed also my free one month  awsome,1
does what it says on the tin would be 5 stars if the android app came with the swipe to queue gesture,0
the lyrics is delay whenever you listen to the song,0
always good and easy to use,1
never had a problem  i love this app,1
love the way spotify makes my mix list and all other playlist,1
we can hear songs in between adds prepared for adds play list every song adds,0
it was amazing coz you can hear all the songs you want specially my favorite group sb19 from the philippines thank you spotify,1
i love spotify they give us the lyrics so if you want to sing along theres no more guessing i laugh every time i see ive gotten lyrics wrong its awesome,1
its so annoying when i want to play music on my playlist it randomly adds the most shittiest song and cant get any of the ones i like,0
everything is awesome  although your premium is little expensive but i still have it myy only concern is when you guys gonna fix mic drop option it will change spotify totally  its awesome i tried once i dont remember it worked for one song  now its useless,1
app is generally good but occasionally slow and buggy i also have troubles occasionally with controlling songs playing and playlists when casting to an external device,0
fun enjoyable ,1
great can use a little work,1
i try to play the song on my play list and play songs i didnt add,0
whats with the shuffle thing and why is that my only option to play the song in the album let me listen to stuff i like and not wait for it to come up in the shuffle like what the hell i dont want to listen to stuff i dont like just so that i can find the one i personally like its such a stupid feature and also why the hell cant i choose a song to play in an album why the heck do i have to put it on shuffle its so hard to work with honestly and its such a stupid update,0
found more of what i wanted to hear with spotify than any other app,1
so many ads,0
i love the app and the wide variety of listening choices,1
its a good music app but only 6 skips per hour is dumb and way to many ads way to many and i hate that you have to shuffle your likes songs like why cant you go in order but its a good music app but its dumb,0
confusing hard to use,0
bug after bug,0
spotify is expectionally good but i feel there are still areas left for improvements like fresh song recommendations based on one random song,0
such a great app for discovering new musicthanks to the members playlistsvery easy to find almost anything you could wanti still buy cds as theyre superior in sound qualitybut saying thatit all depends on the system youre using im happy using spotify with headphonesand like i saidto find new music,1
download songs are not showing offline after 23 days without internet  fix it,0
best music app ever keep up the excellent work and dont worry about the cancel culture there idiots,1
car mode is annoying im sick of having to choose stop car mode please,0
the best music app n experience ever kudos to the creatorbut make it a bit cheap to give access to all n sundry,0
best app ever premium is cheap and ads arent as bad free music always you can play it even when your device is off did i mention that if youre in the app while watching an ad you get 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening soo easy to search up your favorite songs and find new ones playlists are easy to make to this is truly the best app for listening to music,1
great music that i use to study,1
its a pretty good app but it could be better would be nice if you could introduce a feature that tells the genre of songsalbums also please do something about the connectivity thanks,1
the auto play still not fixed its been 2 years now and it only happens in mobile and also when youve been using it for long time your old radio will be replace if you listen to new kind of music damn it suck  edit 1 star,0
very difficult to set up play list add multiple artist but only play 1 artist not very user friendly,0
pls help i can not play selected song pls all i want is free music,0
beat ever,1
after new update spotify only told us to buy premium  so much ads ,0
its not bad wish theyd move the hide this song from in between liked and add to playlist because it just makes sense often hit it by accident,1
love that i can pick my own music genre and make my own playlist,1
music and podcasts when i exercise shower cook eat whenever i want to feel upbeat focused or just want to listen to a great interview great app,1
songs in my playlist keep repeating only shuffling through a few then plays the song it played 2 songs ago i pay for premium but will cancel if not fixed soon,0
really good but the ads are so long,0
very nice btw check out my epic playlist nice songs,1
spotify is just shutting off every time im on instagram at the same time as playing music,0
great app but what a shame youve removed your car mode settings thats where i use the app the most and no im not interested in your new in-car device my car is probably too old to support it anyway,0
im so glad that i can find almost every song that i like i wish they had my two favorite songs still with you by jungkook and promise by jimin other than that its great,1
honestly this app is just all around amazing i have no bad things to say,1
keep me company,1
this app is just superb there is only one suggestion when i opened this app it automatically started playing songs which ive heard last time other than this everything is good i really loved that this app contains podcast thank you spotify,1
spotify premium is a good service spotify the free version is literally unusable the app runs just fine,0
awesome app just awesome especially the blend feature,1
why have you moved the pause to the left and the skip to the middle this is by far the most nonsensical and absurd update ive ever seen i cant even begin to fathom the thought process that went into this update the only somewhat logical explanation is that spotify is trying to annoy the consumers enough to warrant angry tweets about it in order to gain traction i wont change to another music service because spotify has the best ui apart from this by a long shot so please fix it,0
iiii hate this app please close thiss right now i cant skip or next the song and so many freaking ads i hate this app ,0
fine however id like to be able to choose what song the shuffle starts at and most of the web players features aside from that its a fine app for music and playlists,1
i rate 1 over 5 not judgement when u want to play the song that u want to hear its comes to shuffle it dont want you to play the song and it always shuffle the spotify only wants you to pay so u can hear the song and when u play the song in library it only sing the chorus not the whole song pls i want you to make it better,0
im not entirely sure what is happening at spotify headquaters but this app has degraded to the point where i cannot use it without playlist list queue issues extreme delay when switching songs on low internet signal i have premium songs randomly stop playing when disconnecting from the internet i have premium and they are downloaded songs queued dont play and songs loop in the queue without me queueing it excessive loading times when connected to the internet switching to applemusic,0
i am facing issues in spotify from last 7 to 10 days when i play the song its strat and i listen 5 to 10 miniute and automatically song stopped and i again open spotify and play a song but than again this issue it is only playing 5 to 10 miniute and after that automatically turn off please check this out it is problem in update or anything else,0
plays great few if any adds but no download for free version,0
can you please add a feature where you can move songs aka change the order,1
stop playing on car stereo at the beginning of february looks as though a lot of people are having this issue as well,0
the notification system seems to be broken after the new update i dont see it if i play songs if the app was in the background but was not playing music and if im playing songs and pause it i am unable to dismiss the player notification by swiping i need to close the app for it to get dismissed,0
amazing program good that it dosent turn off after you turn off youre phone unlike youtube music and a lot of songs recommended ,1
spotify is okay not great for playing music but it is the worst podcast platform its extremely irritating that there are now so many spotify exclusive podcasts when they are so bad at streaming podcasts it doesnt remember where i left off and randomly in the middle of a podcast itll stop and start playing a different episode as for music spotify seems to choose the cheapest option to play weird covers or other languages rather than the popular or desired version of a song,0
love the playlist of music put together for me,1
i bought a pioneer head unit with spotify on them for both my cars this was over 1000 and was working fine in both cars until a recent spotify update decided that this feature the main reason i bought them was no longer going to be available i tried installing a previous version of spotify but spotify has systematically been removing older apks from places that allow you to download them so now i have 1000 worth ofradio hurry up and fix this,0
constantly asks for additional bluetooth permissions it doesnt need and theres no way to turn off the requests spotify does not need the ability to see nearby bluetooth devices and i should not need to decline permission over and over again give us the option to say no not maybe later no theres no way to block the notification via android either which is especially frustrating if this feature is not removed im moving elsewhere,0
why the hell am i getting adverts before podcasts when i pay premium,0
1only app in my phone that takes 50-60 secs to launch 2 it says enjoy the next 30 minutes of uninterrupted music and proceeds to show an ad every 5 minutes pathetic app,0
the sound is very clear,1
1 star because you can not just drop advertisement after every single song  are we streaming song or spotify making us watch advertisement according to me spotify should pay us for watching these advertisement ,0
i hate the upgrade you cant turn the songs off,0
i can bear with the ads but please add the lyrics feature to the app  its been two months since i wrote this so when are we getting the lyrics lol you guys keep releasing updates for an app that does the bare minimum and doesnt even have the lyrics feature worldwide yet,0
its good for general music listening and i use it daily however podcasts and canvas are not available for me if i switch to another account they appear but on my current account with premium membership they arent i have all my playlists and downloaded songs on my current account and switching will be a slow process so this issue has to be fixed asap,0
paid subscriber dealing with a bad release and looks like others are too app keeps cutting out and stopping where is your qa dept this is a broken release,0
this app is ok but adds sometime broke the perfect part but i love it tho,1
last update has tons of bugs the play bar wont show so i cant pause the music i have to shut the whole app to do that the music will also shut off in the middle of a song for no reason not thrilled with this premium experience,0
i love using this app just i want to close the app tab and play the music but otherwise l love it its great it has podcasts and plenty of music and its not to hard to find a song they also reccommend good songs for you its really nice 1010,1
its a great app but u can barely skip songs and it has way to many ads also it plays songs i didnt even add to my playlist i hate that i can barely listen to any songs its annoying me,0
bad sound quality damn i wish i can refund my purchase on premium package,0
it was good at first but after my free trial ended i could no longer listen to music when i went to my liked songs and tapped on it only a short version of the song would play even shuffling my liked song playlist wouldnt work some random song i didnt even like would start playing,0
im fine with ads just dont make them pause the music i like to have music playing while im doing stuff its super annoying having to stop what im doing to walk over to my phone to press play to listen to an ad,0
best app for music i recommend it to everyone who likes music has overall best options of genres and artists available,1
i pay premium its worth it for the most part but every couple years i want to clear my liked songs please please add a feature that allows mobile users to clear all liked songs in settings or something but keep liked songs in playlist,1
cuberstalers cgberbullies narcissistic hackers bff the whole guns dont kill people people kill people vail to hide behind its a good thing your not spinach then you can be recalled,1
i love the downloads although sometimes i would like for them to download a little faster and if they had that singalong lyrics 2 that would be great,1
good but ads ,1
i cant even play 3 songs without the app crashing every 10-15 minutes its getting really frustrating im a premium member but it feels like i paid the subscription for nothing,0
spotify is awesome i havent found any song yet that i dont have access to the app is so easy to use and making playlists couldnt be easier or more fun highly recommend a monthly subscription to this app 5 stars,1
a great app for music and podcasts,1
honestly i loved spotify until i believe it was one of the last updates i used to be able to listen to 6 songs or so and listen to 3-4 ads no problem here recently i have only been able to hear 1 song maybe 2 before it literally plays endless ads im talking 10 ads the only way i have gotten them to stop is to get completely out of the app and go into it again its incredibly annoying especially when i only have an hour to listen to music at work before we open,0
i love this app i use it every day and its so easy and hanfull,1
great im using this app for five years and always great,1
very good wide range of music and songs,1
i love spotify its the only music app i will use,0
keeps bugging out wont allow me to control music,0
a rip off i canceled my premium subscription last month with spotify and deleted the app they said 3 months free after i paid 999 tax they took two payments out last month a week apart so i canceled the subscription and today they tried again to take money from my account luckily i took all the money off of my paycheck card so that this wouldnt even be a possibility for spotify to steal my money for services they lied about if there were negative stars i would give them a -5 star rate,0
i rate it 1  becuase when i open spotify it always says that no connection internet but i have my internet,0
i enjoy this spotify love music and the podcasts they have,1
love this app plays in the background easily but alot of ads get one every two songs and i have a lot of songs in my playlist so if you guys can put less ads would be really good,0
since the last update i have lost the ability to connect to all my speakers have uninstall the app deleted all data  reinstalled but its made no difference really disappointing,0
i love it i can play my music whenever i want to and loud as i want to and nobody has to hear it thank you spotify,1
oh man spotify works great for me i just love songs i like listen to them every second no matter what i an doing songa are always there in background just the fact that the ads really interupt the music session,1
the app does not load artist images and album and song art properly pages often appearing blank this never happened previously,0
very good app i can listen to all my favourite songs but the premium is expensive and it is a shame you cant peek at the next song but i love this app ,1
very nicesong unspeckted and no any add and no any problem during the hearing the song this app is very smart likes other,1
all is good now a couple of months of car bluetooth issues with it but sorted with recent updates love family premium lots of listening here,1
extra-ordinary extraordinary ready when im ready letting me explore the stars like observatory,1
love spotify hate the app its the worst shuts off randomly the widget barely works i have uninstalled and reinstalled its not the phone either its like this on my last 3 phones been terrible for years,0
keeps crashing opens without playback controls crashes phone sometimes when plugged into android auto,1
i dont support lies and disinformation and will never return to spotify as long as joe rogan is on their platform ive just removed spotify from my roku channels and have canceled my premium subscription to spotify my final act is to uninstall spotify from my smart phone spotify may think applying an advisory warning to rogans podcast is sufficient to let people know he is lying to them but ii dont  i will not pay goid money to support lies and propaganda,0
its now annoying it keeps on saying no internet connection even though i am connected to wifi,0
i like the app and dont mind all the ads but the one thing that annoys me is that you cant choose what song you listen to and this is only on mobile which frustrates me even more also recently i tried to listen to a album and random songs that arent in the album started playing and they werent even from the same music artist its just a bit of a joke like i just wanna listen to the album,0
how man i wanna listen to my song i like not 28 different songs i dont like but you force me to listen to in recommend dont ruin my music experience pls,1
hate this app so much now spotify became so money hungry and so many ads cant listen to one song without hearing 4 ads in a row like im not even kidding i got 5 ads in a row,0
i like the playlists and listening to podcasts,1
full of bugs and some of my songs became unavailable,0
amazing but sometimes theres too many ads but apart from that i love it,1
excellent app spotify class,1
i honestly cannot figure out how to use this i have three decades of experience in it and this ux is utterly baffling to me,0
adsss  useless app only for listening ads,0
great music app professional ,1
charged for premium but unable to use premium features like very high quality audio,0
your app is fine but why so much of ads but i love it any way,1
the blend is not working and the ads are consecutive,0
hey folks there is some major issue with running this app on mobile data please fix it i have paid for this app but still cant use it anytime i step out of my house edit its fixed,0
easy fun great music every time my favorite music app the only one i pay for 1010,1
app constantly freezes and loses internet connectivity on my samsung galaxy s21 plus,0
completely bugged over the past week unusable,0
great selection great service easy to use,1
five star rating once i have received an update that you guys will release lossless option for songs every one is doing it why cant you i love spotify and its algorithm but i use apple music for spatial and dolby atmos content please spotify release the atmos and spatial option ,0
i love that if i serch an artist it only plays songs from said artist ps only went premium because of the adds which are very anoying,0
this app is so so so so ruined they have to make it so i can at least choose any song i want they can keep any other feature all i want is to play my favorite songs thats all and they have ruined pls make it so you can choose any song you want,0
love it i can have my music any where 1 downside if my son and i use our account at the same time one of us will have to use our downloaded music,1
well realy love spotify but very time im playing a game while using spotify music randomly stops so still a good music app,1
very nice all music,1
i love the design and the delivery i just realised it compatible with my google mini home and booom its fun  time,1
the best music app but just one problem too many ads irritate every user and it irritates the user and kind of hates the premium plan and tend to not buy it,0
plays seemingly in background no controls no meta data sent to other devices cannot turn off change songs can select something new but then just does the same with the new selection this should never have passed initial testing,0
please fix app on my galaxy s10 is using too much battery on a full charge uses 22 otherwise great music serviced ,0
the app was all right before but now it wont show me the now playing bar thats basically its main feature completely removing all storage and cache and reinstalling didnt help so it went from four stars to one for me,0
its simple to use kinda confusing but its awesomethink imma so get the hang of it dont think i can give it five s cause its kinda complicated maybe its jus me  dnspng,1
great sound could be louder tho,1
hate this app worst app ever so many ads extremely annoying app so many restrictions except for premium users deserves no star,0
this app just makes horrible updates for example say you want to find a nice song for your playlist so you go click onto the song to hear it for a couple seconds they took the feature away so now you wont know what songs u like,0
best media app out there,1
does not let me play my entire library there are too many albums to like individually,0
i love spotify even though when my premium ran out i could no longer access my library of songs,1
songs will stop mid way through randomlynevet used to have this problem,0
its really good but it glitches from time to time like now for instance i can play my podcast but its not showing its playing and cannot skip ahead on the front screen or anything because its not showing up i have tried afew things to get it to work properly but it just ends up working itself out which is frustrating other than that its great 80 of the time,0
try to sign up but it say my email already connected to another account but i cant even log in without password or reset the password alway crash,0
high bass good quality sound best app,1
i still dont have the update where i can see the songs lyrics what do i do,0
any blue tooth device when commected will cause spotify to automatically open and play the most recent song you played last no way to prevent the auto play needs to a addressed in the next update or you will loose subscribers upon doing research this is a known problem since 2015 not sure why developers havent fix this major issue only fix is to log out and log back in every time,0
this app really sucks i dont know what happened but last week ive been getting these bugs like my liked songs are only playing in 10 seconds and when you exit from the app it will stop also i cant play my normal playlists without playing it in the shuffle button this frustrates me,0
cool,1
it have very nice playlist,1
its better than itunes i can tell you that lol,1
i listen to this app at least 11 hours a day i love it,1
i still dont have the lyrics ive updated my spotify cleared my cache but still nothing,0
buggy search bar wont work properly,0
jaishreeram bahut achha app hai mai to bolta hu app bhi istmaal karo,1
its a very good audio platform i have ever seen i can also create my own playlist in it,1
used to use spotify for parties since everyone could play music together sessions absolutely suck now its a hassle to let people join them and the music plays on every device its extremely annoying now i just use youtube since guests can join without hassle and add stuff to the queue,0
app can play in the background lots of music styles awesome pre-picked daily music selections 5 stars,1
horrible ui making it confusing to navigate and non stop ads on the free version,0
first time downloading this app easy to use recommend highly,1
great audio quality,1
it plays random music in playlist  i just hate it,0
used to love it but after the past couple updates its so broken i cant stand it this is the second review i have left on how broken it is too something needs to be done or im gonna look elsewhere im not gonna pay 15 a month for something that doesnt work much longer,0
after the update the app keeps on saying no wifi connection even though i can search for songs and everything the downside is that i cant access the lyrics album radio etc my wifi connection seems to be working fine with 300mbps i dont know what the issue is its been bothering me for the last week hence the 1sl star rating,0
how can an app so old be so broken now playing pop-up keeps disappearing and i have to reinstall the app every time to bring it back why just not have the navigation buttons permanently at the bottom bar with full hd screens it shouldnt be such a problem would it,0
i loved spotify until the new upgrade i cant stop my interaction with the app and have uninstalled it until it is fixed very disappointed -,0
ughi dont like the new updatenowi cant hear my fav song when i am play game ,0
love spotify i dont think any other musicpodcast streaming platform is as good as spotify highly recommend 1010,1
please combine stations and spotify matter of fact combine all the individual spotify apps into one this is one of the main reasons why i havent switched from amazon music switching between two apps just to hear a station is not intuitive also its a fairly interruptive experience,0
every time my bluetooth is on spotify automatically starts ive gone into the settings menu and turned auto start off and triple checked that nothing auto is on but it still does it every time i open it i uninstalled it for a 2nd time,0
you can delve into the archiveswhich i do regularly always something to inspire you,1
it has every song you could possibly want and more,1
spotify was great but i have no clue whats happening it freezes constantly i swipe to change a song and it wont change or the song changes but it stays on the previous songs artwork it no longer allows me to change songs through my notification bar and continues to play music when i click on videos on twitter youtube etc,0
everytime i save my music to the sd card the app decides to reset the default storage to local storage this has happened 3 times now i hate having to redownload everything again its heavily inconvenient fix this please otherwise its a great app,0
the app barely works and they show ads to premium users,0
idk why when im get into my liked playlist song become short idk why and how its happend but i hope you got solutions why probally the update or something else bcs before this its normal got a long music but now its diffrent,0
i dig spotify i just wish we had more options for showing credits and a few more insights on the business end and that we have more protection from the so called promoters who manipulate numbers with impunitythats what it looks like anyway,0
the best,1
this is a fab app that i pay premium for so worth it one small thing this week the sky vip official top 40 hasnt refreshed since last sunday sunday 15th may 2022 otherwise i am enjoying my spotify experience,1
the song that i want to listen doesnt even play it keeps playing other songsn spoils my whole mood  i wish u could sort this prob asap,0
long time user but lately the app start crashing an sometimes volume goes down just annoyed,0
horrible app is not working most of the time,0
i would have given 5  if the commercials didnt repeat so often or we could tag commercials to block  ones that we have no interest in,0
i love this app,1
this app is good but if you put romanized lyrics it could be better but its good,1
audio quality is exceptional,1
disgusting update too many advertising,0
when i was creating my account at the end when i setted password and email i tapped on create account they said it was an error then told me to change my password after i changed my password they said that the password and email is not suitable combined together at that point i got annoyed and deleted the app and even though i created an account the first time it all got deleted and i had to make a second account but it didnt worked hope that it will not happen again when i download it again,0
theres always show no internet connection when im using cellular to run the app for the reference my internet is no problem at allplus i enable wifi and cellular for this app which i can run nicely using cellular even downlod songs before this we pay every month for the premium but this is what we get please fix it asap,0
best variety of good musicians im overwhelmed with this experience that i choose to rate at 5 stars very satisfied,1
outstanding app hope you give more freebies to new and old users,1
before october 2021 i was enjoying the app i can play any songs but when october 2021 it changed every thing i need premium to play songs this app when from free to pay thats why i rate it a 1,0
latety my spotify keep not responding send bug report so many times but still not responding before this i got no problem with this,0
its basically a pay-to-play platform otherwise you cant pick the specific songs that you want to listen to it wouldnt be the worst thing in the world but the algorithm sucks and doesnt know how to suggest songs that fit what youre looking for either tried it deleted it,0
i have had spotify for a very long time and just recently i have had it take so long to open and when it does open it says i dont have any internet when im connected to internet and in all it just drives me crazy and if yall dont fix it im going to delete it and never use yalls app again,0
always great song and at a fair price,1
i have to agree with the other recent reviews ive loved using the spotify app for years but recently it has been buggy with songs cutting out or the app crashing still think its one of the better music apps out there,0
love spotify have been using it for ages now pretty much since you guys came out only issue i have is it is really hardinconvenient to remove songs from your playlist so a long time user like me has a playlist thats over 1000 songs and its really hard to de clutter songs that im not into as much now,0
i love spotify but i hate that the part that shows the song playing and how long it has left disappears i like to skip to a part of the song but can i hate the songs in my playlist shuffle instead of playing in order  some of the songs dont even play please fix,0
wonderfully odd connexions just slightly disappointed with the settingsreally need to be lightened somehowconfusingbut it all works,1
i like ,1
easy to use it doesnt have every song in the world but it has most american music and top foreign content creators if anyone wants to use the app for free then its honestly not that good of an app they got rid of the ad free music pop-up and the ad breaks are longer around 2 minutes each and i dont use it enough to justify a 120year subscription people that are willing to pay i would still look elsewhere before you sign up because of the price,0
amazing has many playlists of your choice to choose from,1
better collection of songs than gaana or interface is very realistic and smooth color,1
its a very good app there are lots of music in it,1
i have had spotify for 7 plus years nothing else can beat it,0
wonderful musicgreat app,1
after last update i cant play my playlist properly,0
use youtube instead at least you can choose the songs you want and play them in whatever order for a service directed on only playing music spotify cant even do it properly please just use youtube music,0
ill say its the best app to listen songs but the ads are so annoying so ill suggest you guys to get premium before they start the ads but you guys should download it,0
i love the way it shows the lyrics,1
the ads i will play like 2 or 3 songs and get 4 ads and its really stupid one time i got 3 ads and played 1 song and it played 4 more ads and its really annoying because it wants you to get priemum if they will fix the ads ill put 5 starsmost of the time the ads are like 15-30 seconds long and you cant skip ,0
it is a very beautiful and useful application i want to download songs how can it be done,1
spotify is the best but if you ever hate getting an ad just close the app and reopen it and youll be able to skip the ad,0
awesome app cant believe ive only started using it now ive been missing out on the best experience ever awesome,1
considering how youre like a multi-billion dollar company you wouldnt expect this app to be this bad its really laggy and crashes way too often sometimes you try to search for a song but cant cause nothing shows up and the main menu keeps loading for 7 years after opening the app every time also bring back the x on the perma noti why would you even get rid of it its so much more troublesome getting rid of it without it,0
everything stops when screen shuts off other than that its ,0
flexibility variety reliable,1
it is spotify after all,1
i finally downloaded the app and it wont work it just constantly says that im offline ill just stick with amazon and pandora at least i can listen to music there,0
i love spotify unbelievable amount of choices i am so glad my son told me about spotify thanks for all the hours of good music,1
ill give yall a 3 not because i hate it this actually has to be one of my favorite apps but im a premium user and yall still wont show my lyrics tab i have upgraded and reinstalled so manyyy times like come on,0
highly recommend spotify it seems better than yt to me,1
not sure whats going on but the latest version of the app breaks my controls in my car making it impossible to use until i kill the app and reopen it the it works until next time,0
the app is good however its frustrating that i cannot play a specific song after i search it but the whole album because i havent upgraded to premium,0
one of the worst apps on my phone currently seeking alternatives constantly buggy inconsistent interaction with google home biggest complaint ads during podcast i pay a monthly fee and am still forced to suffer through ads on some podcasts,0
the music quality is top class,1
offline podcasts functionality is garbage - can download episodes for offline listening but then is impossible to find them and when you do you cant play them dont get exclusivity for podcasts when your player is trash,0
a chance to reverse songs on free tear,0
your recomended musics are cool and i can listen and download easily everything what i want i love it,1
probably the best music streaming app available at the moment interface is dated though this is where apple music triumphs spotify,0
the best possible alternative to the sirius xm trap on new cars especially since new cars dont have cd players,1
needs  or - 10 second double tap feature,0
i can find most of the songs i like and accept for a couple glitches its been a great app to use,1
had only no song only hard,0
to spotify incredible musics youve got there man now though,1
music good podcasts can be good - but the half listened to section has not been working for me recently,0
ads after every song ridiculous,0
it worked and now it doesnt at all i pay spotify premium just for it not to work,0
i enjoy the playlist and quality of the music,1
where are the controls have had to uninstall to switch off,0
good app just not so many adds would be good and it gives me 30 minutes of uninterrupted listening but i didnt ask for it,0
love this app but since the last update the app has weird bugs songs stop and start playing constantly tapping a song plays it but doesnt show the bottom nav cant pause or do anything elseand the app revives and starts playing in the car even after being force shut,1
finally i can play my songs tbh,1
i  this music app u can stream  create your own playlist by listenin any type of music genre artists or bands of your choice way better than usin cds ipod  radio ,0
so easy to use and there is a great selection of music,1
having an issue where the app hides the ability to skip pause and so on,0
it can create playlist and add downloaded songs to playlists and there is a button where you get free premium no credit card needed for 4 months,0
i need help everytime i pick a song i want it plays a different song please fix this bug ,0
best music app there is period,1
i use spotify all the time it helps me sleep it lessens my anxiety but for some reason recently it wont let me heart songs or hide them its not too big of an issue i guess but i would like it to be seen to,1
whats up with music lagging now on great unencumbered wifi as if the bluetooth settings pop up wasnt enough of an annoyance,0
it doesnt even play the song you want to listen seriously,0
fantastic music but why delete the shuffle button please bring it back,0
super annoying now whats going on music just stops playing the song bar gets lost and i cant even go to the next song if it is playing i have to close the app and restart it too many times in one single day pleasefixthis i dont pay premium for this,0
constant issues with podcast playback app loses track where it left off frequently encumbering interface the watch video for 30min ad free rarely ever works could be much better but they focus on spewing ads every couple minutes horrible horrible app,0
this is literally the worst app that you can choose for listening to the music it doesnt even let you to choose your music unless youre premium but its not a only problem  after a few months suddenly the app doesnt let you to log in such a waste of time ,0
i really enjoy spotify it has many songs and podcasts you can listen to its also nice that if you download episodes you can listen offline ,1
the app is very dopenice music arrangement,1
great for playing music but hate it when you cant listen to the song you want and you cant have the song playing on loop,0
spotify is my favourite invention of all time easily,1
super glitchy  always crashing never shows the play menu so you cant control what youre playing consistently having to uninstall and reinstalling just to get it to work sometimes multiple times a day,0
great formusic and stuff just wish you could pock a single song and that it wasnt on shuffle the whole time to make it free other than that ive got no problems,1
ive been using this app for almost 2 years now and i had no problems until now whenever i switch to offline mode my downloaded music and playlists dont play and now whenever i press on a song the bar thing at the bottom which shows the song im playing does not show so i cant even pause or rewind or fast foward my songs and that is creating other problems as well please help,0
i like it but the new update is trash and is makes me want to get rid of it please fix it,0
awesome gospel songs good selection process of genre no buffering just as good as playing the cds directly uninterupted great app,1
one of my the best music streaming app so i give it 5,1
great selections and very easy to use,1
ads are really irritating,0
app force closes constantly new bugs pop up every week for how big this app is it shouldnt have so many issues,0
customer service is terrible they dont answer emails back no customer service phone number no way to cancel subscription total garbage no help from them at all they just want the monthly subscription costs,0
dont know if this app could be any worse updates that no one wanted constantly undownloading songs even though when i connect back to wifi they reappear christ sort it out already before someone who cares even a little bit overtakes you cough apple music cough,0
when you change country its will ask you so many thingsto change country it should update like other apps,0
ive had this app for a long time with no issues but recently its stopped giving me the now playing window that allows me to stop and start the current song i have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling it if there was a recent update its not working,0
easy and convenient to get the music and songs,0
love the new lyrics feature recommended for music lovers ,1
it annoys me greatly that daniel ek is so rich off the back of this terrible app its the most buggy app ive ever had controls constantly disappear meaning the only way i can stop a track is to uninstall the entire app thankfully a family member is paying for it not me,0
my songs arent playing inspite of having a high speed internet connection everytime i try to play a song it says you are offline please fix this bug spotify,0
this app went to garbage in just a week everything is buggy and terrible,0
great all the music you want at uou finger tips plus it never drops out and quality is great works with all my devices,1
hello team why my spotify is not working in a stable wifi connection i cant stream any songs while connected to wifi,0
great app  although i wish the would work with pioneer 2600nex to get whatever glitch the new version has to prevent it from work otherwise 1010,1
great app though i wish songs for company like sega could be here,1
i dont know if its with the new upgrade its being stopping while playing and wont play for fee seconds both on mobile and on tvpls fix this as i cant pay for premium and still go through this,0
app opens randomly when i open other apps love spotify for listening to music but since the last update it has just randomly started to open and play music mostly when i open other apps my battery is draining so fast as sometimes i dont even realise its playing if im outside working and cant hear it this needs fixed or ill be cancelling my subscription and deleting the app,0
pretty good but id like it better if they had more songs there are some original songs which i cant find here still i use it a lot and love it nonetheless ,1
best music app that i had used yet,1
best spotify app best music people ever one family best beats music and best playlist love my music beat premium best updates,1
i cant download music i just started using it though,0
every time i start a song it keeps crushing,0
my ratings for this app keep going down same bug that has been plaguing the pay options resurfaced after a fix when i asked for a refund for my subscription they said no because it has been 14 days but the app didnt work for the past 14 days find another service if you have an android phone ,0
about 90 of the app space is wasted on useless podcast recommendations when i just want to listen to music it becomes a pain to actually get to my playlists there should be a separate app for music and podcasts then i might actually use that or just let me pin things or hide content from the front page also the app shows annoying popups to invite other people to buy premium really ruins the experience,0
tons of great music for everyone this app is very user friendly i highly recommend spotify to everyone spotify is the 1 music app out there if you dont have it get it well worth it,1
i really enjoyed this app i just wish there was a way to buy the albums permanently that way i can always enjoy the song without needing to go online for a long time,1
i am trying to login to my account with my phone number but it is taking ages to get the vacation code or something and am unable to login and the ads are annoying,0
amazing,1
spotify is a part of my everyday life its worth the money if music is as important to you as it is to me,1
i love it soo much and i will rate it a 4 star the problem is that there are constant ads and the singing option near the lyrics doesnt seem to appear for me anymore,0
great experience using this app its amazing,1
love this app but i wish that it allowed you to sort your playlists by the songs release dates please add this feature,1
can not stop it from from automatically starting everytime i get into the car,1
the computer app is awesome but the phone app feels oversimplified its missing information such as track length number of songs in a playlist number of streams on a song and when a song was added to a playlist,0
love love love the music and that you can share your playlist with your friends ,1
spotify is absolutely amazing i just wish it didnt cost so much,1
when i play music from this apps my brain is relaxing this is my stress reliever,1
nice app i love it and its easy to use,1
great service but latest update broke the app randomly stops playing sometimes music plays but control bar doesnt show up until you restart app widget no longer works have tried reinstalling several times to no avail will happily revert review once fixed,0
no way to clear the queue except when playing specific playlists extremely annoying also cant clear queuenow playing if only one song is queued,0
this app introduced me to an easy way to find music that i didnt even know existed awesome thank you,1
same as others have me tinned app is supper buggy as of late not sure whats going on,0
the app keeps glitching for me when i select a song it plays but i dont have the window where i can play pause and skip songs or the banner at the bottom have to crash the app and sometimes will come back again everything else is all good,1
spotify is the app to have when you need assistance while driving good music or when you need directions on the road while driving it just makes your driving time must easier and enjoyable what a pleasure to have thank you spotify get this app,1
enjoyed every selection of music,1
this is a really good app for listening to your favorite songs and podcast,1
poorer by the month lots of my liked songs have disappeared because rights have been removed by the artists and now my playlist of 630 songs only shows about 25 ridiculous,0
beautiful songs to chill and unwind,1
i love spotify but i hate the way you guys edit my playlist and everytime i change it 2 minutes later you guys change it again you guys need to fix that,0
kinda convenient but they keep sacking artists and it is slow and buggy during offline use,0
awesome app love the podcasts,1
for some reason i cant adjust the volume,0
im extremely annoyed with the way the app automatically logs out of my account for the last 2 days i havent been able to access it via any mode whether its facebook or google or using my own account id and password have tried all possible ways of solving the issue whether its reinstalling or clearing the cache but still the app just doesnt work had it not been my curated playlist of liked songs i would have uninstalled it long time back best collection of music but worst operation,0
they recently restored car view and it works well,1
it is very nice not having to pay to be able to listen to music and podcasts im talking about youtube and youtube music having to pay for them ,1
im enjoying myself listening to the love songs it relaxes me,1
this app was good in 2017,1
recently the notification in the pull down menu on your phones home screen will keep displaying what you were listening to even after you close the app and you swipe the notification awayand it comes back a minute later fix this now,0
i love this app before but one day i want to play music so i go here in spotify but it was already updated and it was sooooooo terribleso plssss return the old spotify,0
i pay far too much money for this app to randomly turn my music off in the middle of everything i do every song every shuffle every damn day,0
super nice,1
wish it would play on my watch when my phone isnt on,0
when i try to play a song it always shows this playlist is empty go to home to find playlists just for you how to resolve this issue,0
really like my spotify it has everything i need in a music app the family plan is great if youre like me and have multiple family members living in one home i have had all the music apps at one time or another spotify continues to be my favorite,1
i dont why its keep getting closed automatically with out any error,0
no words i have used a lot of music streaming apps but still spotify is far better only problem with this app in my opinion is the amount of ads are too much it would be better if the amount of ads are lesser and we can enjoy music more freely anyways thank you spotify,0
great app hate that i cant play songs i want on my cellphone app is buggy on the pc updated and everything but still at least i can play specific songs i want to listen to on the pc,0
if you listen long enough this app will eventually silently crash the player and whatever youre listening to will run in the background and be home unkillable you have to restart your phone to fix it,0
this app remembers that music i like and makes playlists from it and changes it frequentlylove that,1
too many minor issues for the market leader playback stops without reason especially in podcasts playback works fine but controls disappear so app has to be force stopped to get them back the thing were you pick a song on a play list and then jumps to another random track as you click out of spotify none of these are terrible but they collectively damage the user experience and should have been fixed,0
i already downloaded the songs and when im offline i cant play any songs now i need to go online and we have a slow internet connection in our place i even turned on offline mode but still i cant play my music punyeta,0
one of the best music streaming platforms in the world its algorithm is capable of giving you a playlist tht fits your taste nonstop,1
currently running into a bug when connecting to anything bluetooth or via my car wandroid auto heavy issues playing music ending up needing to restart my phone multiple times to fix its issue no currently playing bar showing up in the app or externally,0
ever since the update the app has become completely unusable the control bar has completely disappeared from the app itself and from my lock screen and i cant skip or pause songs i cant even turn off the shuffle mode now extremely frustrating and disappointing i used to love this app hopefully this will be fixed soon and i wont need to switch to another music streaming service,0
offline mode no longer working in latest update,0
hate the ads but love the variety of music,1
really appreciate and enjoy the music,1
good app had fun hearing songs but the ad makes it really worse,0
if i am listening a book a i want an option by which i can go to a specific time where i had left last time please do something for that,0
just thank you music gives me so much motivation,1
i thought my old phone was the issue but i have a brand new phone and the same issies persist music and podcast stop mid stream or controls suddenly become unavailable the only way to fix it is to restart the phone,0
they took down my last 1 star review and seem to block low reviews ads are unbearable long louder than the music spotify seems to add unrelated songs to playlists often will be switching to pandora,0
its autoplay is off yet playing as autoplay,0
who is releasing these updates to the app without testing them current version of the app doesnt show now playing and will play over other audio and has no pause button to press,0
love the app been useing it for maybe a few months maybe like 6 dont know but i love it found a song i love sad i cant repeat it anymore but still good app,1
best mobile streaming service hands down,0
 update  i am pleased to post an update the android version of the spotify app continues to have a much lower volume when using the equalizer however either a chromebook update or a spotify app update corrected the sound quality of the music to such a degree that i no longer need to use the equalizer good job,0
i use multiple apps to listen to music i mainly use spotify on my playstation one improvement i would make is the ability to change the order songs are in in playlists like how you can in youtube music,0
easy to use great selection of songs,1
just an amazing app overall hope you guys are around for generations,1
can be very frustrating to use at times ive had a old phone and now a new one same problems music rarely shows up what im playing on my home screen and sometimes doesnt show up at all on the spotify app when i clearly just select a song or podcast meaning i cant skip to fix this you have to do a reinstall or logout login which fixes it for a time before going through the process again i feel like they have also add a lot more shameless advertisement on podcasts for premium members,0
not a play store bot this app is good however some music i try to find doesnt seem to be available meaning that if you have a specific song you like to hear theres a possibility that it wont be in not to mention all of the ads that really ruin the experience theyre frequent as well overall try out this app if you want but i do recommend it sense the music can be played without being in the app and there isnt anything else out there better,0
fix the app keeps crushing plays what ever it wants doesnt react if i want to switch it off i need to close it from the background,0
pay to win app basically i cant play one song like it only shows a 5 seconds preview of how it sounds i cant even listen to any songs on my playlists there is no point its a pay to win app,0
its better than apple music because iam not to show off on snapchat ect  for screen shot like today people bss ye thodi adds km kre,1
i like it but the ads in the middle of playlists annoy me and the fact that i have to pay to pick a song is annoying,0
why cant i make playlists collaborative anymore this is really annoying,0
im paying for this and i still get ads more and more not sure if its by the company or the podcasters but its country specific so its not a built-in ad even if its by the podcasters you should not allow this i hope youll fix this,0
the freaking suggested songs are just giving me mad issues because when i tried to shuffle play its still playing the freaking suggested song i hope your app will have like exit song or something then i will change the rate,0
i dont like this i cant unstall it and pls fix this and my fav song is not even here so i am so sorry if i made you sad,0
one of the best app i have in my phone if you love music  then consider spotify all my taste buds of music at one place,1
good,1
good in many ways but the bug that makes all my liked songs vanish is no fun at all and it seems they are just unable to fix it only fix is re-install which absolutely is not an appropriate fix,0
theyll put money on hold for themselves in case you subscribe dont look see things pending in my account,0
been listening to spotify for years and love it just wish they would give me a freebie haha,1
i do love spotify but it has been crashing a lot recently i am really hoping this will get fixed soon,0
spotify in my opinion is easy to use reliable and at affordable price,1
spotify please fix or stop shuffling the songs i just want to listen to the music and songs without it shuffling which is why im using youtube instead,0
honestly my only issue is there is no way to remove and undownload individual songs ie discover weekly i can hide an individual song but it still is downloaded and still pops up in my daily mixes etc it sucked thats why i hid it let it disappear and never show up again ffs,0
cant even listen to a song - it plays some random other songs it added to the playlist instead,0
the best site with no ads,1
super but you have to improve,0
love this app its totally rocking it has million of songs plus all my favourite music  like to add small suggestion to developpers  it would be really nice if you guys add statistical section to the app mean - i like to see total playable minutes in my music collection x and total playable minutes allocated to each playlist y of mine also the the percentage allocated to each playlist artist - yx   thanks,1
good apps,1
ads ads ads everywhere everytime it even change your playlist and plays the advertised song like chaand baliyan every here and then for god sake try to understand it can be your favorite song but not every other persons,0
best one,1
i used to love this app but the since the latest update spotify connect wont work i can still cast through chromecast but the audio quality isnt as good a large part of why i pay for premium is for the high quality audio through my amp if this doesnt get fixed soon i am seriously considering cancelling my subscription and going back to being a free user even if it means i have to listen to ads,0
my favorite entertainment for my ears,1
its an interesting and great program so that their hands do not hurt,1
i enjoy listening to music and walking,1
wish id gone primo much earlier for as cheap as chips i can compile and share music eg with lockdown and travelling restrictions here in new zealand i can still be at my mothers side in spirit with a nostalgic compilation specially for her with the help of my sister lindy what a blessing,1
sooooo im listening to this music with my kids that i cant play as this just plays what i dont want in my chosen library then this advert comes on saying books about dirty jokes whilst im listening to it with my children instantly deleted i cant have that said infront of children what the fxxck man,0
only give 3 stars caz of adds caz they says 30 min of uninterrupted music and adds comes after every music,0
this is the best platform for listening to music and have a reasonable fees for those who dont contain high money value,1
please fix that your app is not remembering that i want to have in my library only downloaded category active i think i will change music app because your app is getting worse and worse,0
before you did the update i could go from song to song but now i cant i liked it the way it was,0
some songs old man down by the river and more vanished from my paid subscription and downloaded library,0
spotify routinely shows that they are not interested in artists or their music there are plenty of other music services to choose from choose one of them,0
you got rid of song previews while making playlists who thought that was a good idea,1
i hate the ads literally 3 ads in a row in every 10 minutes please fix this,0
the perfect music app without adds in premium,0
spotify is no like fox news with music i guess when fox news start streaming music this company will have to close,0
amazing streaming music app the sound quality and collections of songs very nice but some of movie songs not available in spotify please add those songs soon,1
please fix the bluetooth connection problem with car audio systems ive tested this on a few vehicles now and when i return to vehicle turn back on and go to play music its saying its playing but theres no sound have to close and open again for it to work,0
good but can be a bit confusing and difficult sometimes u search and play ur particular song and pops up a total different one  spotify should really work on that,1
fix the now playing and bluetooth issue my phone is running on android but its not samsung,0
spotify is the best music app so far  you get to listen to anything you want no ad pop ups no bugs it just runs so smooth,1
removing content for political reasons i do not need nor want some company telling me what i can and can not listen to,1
most recent update has broken app playback bar disappears  can only resolve by force closing and restarting pretty annoying google home integration is still poor shuffling library while connected to a google home speaker is awful it pulls from a small pool of songs with the same starting letters because of this i often have to manually start spotify on my phone then cast my audio via chromecast to get a better shuffle experience - negates the convenience of having a voice enabled device,0
appropriate auto selection of songs and music,1
ive been a spotify user for a long time but just this year im having some discomfort using spotify my internet network is very good but its hard to play music,0
outstanding database of music like the lyrics feature looks of flexibility to create play lists,1
good but on my phone when free trial ends puts all cant do much,0
its a really good app for listening to music on the go but i dislike when random songs i dont know pop up randomly,0
i wanted to start from the beginning of my playlist and wont let me it let me before the update now it wont,1
spotify please let people with the normal version enjoy music and stay happy with the basic functions you provide just like any other app does i cant play songs and even the playlists look different whenever i click on a song it gives me a preview and wont let me play it and only works normally when ive connected it to my laptop and only plays on shuffle pls fix this not everyone can afford premuim and you shouldnt be forcing anyone to buy it by taking away most of the basic functions,1
ive used spotify for those long as i can remember but as long as i can remember its always never let me play music offline and it was wondering if you could fix that and then i will go ahead and keep it if not i will delete it thanks amazing app one it works wonders has all my favorite songs,1
too much ad i will rather prefer reso,0
hell nah this app actually got mad worse i was just gonna check out how its doing then it just randomly logs me out of my account and i cant even get back into it anymore but yeah this app still wont let me listen to my favourite songs unless if i put them in a playlist and shuffle it  i highly recommend using other music apps and not this tbh uninstalled,0
i have literally developed a relationship with spotify i would die without it,0
i been a loyal subscriber for years probably a good 5 years maybe but id say the only problem is that when you go to ur liked songs an you are looking for a specific genre out of the music youve liked the list of genre on your liked songs isnt accurate an its a bit of a pain cause if it was accurate it would be the best for each mood for example wait a minute by willow is pop an alt but it doesnt pop up on my pop genre an i dont even have a alt selection even though i have a lot of alt,0
very solid app recently lots of issues with freezing and not loading albumsplaylists at all requires a force stop to work again,0
though i listen to the music but podcasts in this app are amazingespecially neelesh misras podcast,1
good but too much ads,0
love to listen even when off line thank you spotify,1
i really like it and it works really well usually but ive been having glitches where the playing bar dissappears and i cant pause or play or skip etc and its beyond debilitating,0
good,1
the app has become very slow and often does not respond please fix the error thanks,0
great idea how about you get all the features to actually work on here thanks,1
why is there a spotify added songs in our playlist and liked songs its the most annoying feature where we cant even remove the shuffle song feature seriously considering uninstalling spotify,0
you cant play the song you search for  because it shuffles your music ,0
great app easy to use great app to share your music files with others collaborate folders highly recommend,1
one bug i click my music and random song is there ,0
spotify is more difficult to work than other similar platform but ones you get the hang of it its all good from there scotty boy  spotify playlist check me out  plus if i make a playlist up i want to play it in the order that i set it up on its on shuffle and its a pain when im trying to show my skills to the public what goes with what track after another in a selective way like it should be done by scotty boy  spotify playlist ,0
i enjoy listening songs through spotify app,1
since the latest update im unable to preview songs when adding new songs to a playlist its really irritating since i have no clue what the song sounds like so the add songs feature is completely useless now,0
actually its good but the ads when your enjoying but the ads,1
i am unable to view the lyrics after the new update i tried re-installing the app as well,0
app contacts spotify and shows preferences but doesnt provide playlist when you click on selected items,0
app crashes several times during a single podcast something has gone badly wrong since update,0
worst android port i want to listen to a single song right it adds recommended songs like bro i want 1 song,1
plays awesome music just what the doctor ordered,1
very glitchy app i have to open and close the app multiple times before it loads any of my music even downloaded stuff and it often thinks im offline even when im connected to the internet,0
they are taking 1599 out of account every month and i am not on the premium,0
you can access all ur favourite songs in your playlist listen to your favorite artist or short storys it has good quality and easy to be happy and sing all your problems away best to use speakers or headphones honestly this app is full of happiness and love,1
im a premium member and i still have to watch ads when watching podcasts edit get random freezing the app and also starts playing at unexpected times and the only way to playing to force close it edit continue to have playing issues ,0
very fast to find music,1
love it been using spotify for like 6 years now 1010,1
app glitches and shirs itself down all the time downloads constantly delete themselves and music plays randomly in teh background and you cant pause it,0
this is dumb it wont let you do anything unless you have permuim and it adds songs to my playlist that i dont want and i cant even click the song that i do want to hear and its agrivating and annoying i cant play songs on loop unless i get premium i honestly think this app is only for people who can actually afford to listen to the music which is unfair,0
app keeps crashing once opened,0
i had no problems with this app until the recent update when it started bugging out the song bar doesnt appear and the songs dont glow green when im playing them unless i close out and re open the app,0
im unable to play videos with my spotify premium individual plan,0
the app has horrendous lag on my note 10 yet works fine on my brothers phone i am fully updated to the newest version i can and the issue persists there is something deeply wrong with this app and it needs to be figured out soon,0
its absolutely worth the cost ill take it over any free music app no question all the music and podcasts available that i want joe rogan brought me to spotify,1
great collection and great sound quality,1
i want swipe to queue like on ios version of app also when im only using downloads it loads slowly so dumb,0
trash app even on my own playlists and liked songs i cant choose my desired song and needed to be shuffled oh and whats more is the limited skips i used to love this app so much because i love listening to music but all of what i said ruined this app recent updates just pushes users to buy premium accounts if i could only give a negative star review on this app,0
the get best experience by allowing bluetooth is getting iritating stop it now,0
spotify is the best streaming service there is you can download playlists play songs over and over again or choose them all for free my favourite part is the fact that you can create your own music i like how you can follow artists so that you get notified when they drop a song spotify is smart enough to suggest songs you would like based of your listening and what artists you follow at the end of the year spotify reviews your listening with wrapped this is a fun look back at your year,1
i enjoyed very much with what spotify provided,1
best music app ever,1
new ui isnt user friendly at least give us an option to choose the old ui,0
always great quality always works great,1
why do you give so many updates its so annoying that when im listening to the music the app updates automatically and stops the music instead of giving updates frequently just update the app whenever necessary,0
great place to get hard to find podcasts and a plethora of amazing music,1
the song that i wanted to play cannot play,0
i listened to a podcast with nancy grace ive missed her shes on a different channel now still a great speaker and trying to put killers behind bars for years,0
i want my old spotify bec new ver has no player its disappered mean something wrong with the latest upgrade 0522 ,0
app takes forever to loadlike over 1 min program is very slow to start playing but works after dont know if it is because it is downloading songs or if it is a memory hog i have my songs on an sd card,0
too many ads,0
i love spotify ,1
great app however sometimes my downloaded playlist wont load with bad signal i thought the point of downloading stuff was to listen without good wifi ,0
why is this app so difficult to use for me at least you cant replay songs change where you are in the song and for some reason wont actually let me choose the song i want i can either only click the preview for the song or it puts me in a random playlist but hey the music quality is good,1
i find every song every time,1
hey spotify i dont pay you 30 every 3 months for the app to crash every time i try another app while its playing the background,0
music player portion of the app keeps crashing since the latest update around 4722 i will delete this comment if they fix the problem,0
best music streaming service,1
i have gotten 10 ads in a row trying to listen to a single song the ads were longer then the sond,0
artists as well as paying customers should demand transparency of this company they are ripping off the artists  the paying customers that pay to listen to the music they want to listen to not someone shoved downthier throats that is payolaalso for artist that wont play thier game they get penaluzed because the streams get ratioed more than othersas well as people have expose rhe glendive streaming farmthey need to be investigatedits not as bad a radio yetbut they got expose       ,0
geez you guys are so desperate for money i cant play the songs i want without you having to keep the damn playlist of shuffle i can never get to the right song with skip cause we only have 6 i get about 5 ads ever 2 songs and then you start to play other songs that wernt even in the playist to begin with and so much more the app was good at first untill you had to ruin it by trying to force us to get premium by making the app even more shittier ever update money stealing bastards,0
not sure how you guys manage to have a working amazing music app but then manage to completely break it with updates every other yearmeanwhile the updates literally add no value to the appif it aint broke dont fix it is a nice concept to revisit spotify is amazing when it works,0
i love this app bcs it has wide range of songs but i think it will be better if i can download only 1 song that i like rather than having to download all songs in a playlist i hope spotify can consider this plus i updated my spotify app regularly but still i cant see the song lyrics on my smartphone,0
lately the app has been crashing as soon as i play a song if any solutions plz reply,0
very good app with less cluttered interface,1
unable to make payment using kakao i downloaded this app like 4 months ago and tried many times to make the payment but always failed,0
excellent service,1
the free version of this app is missing key features that are in the pc version there is no reason to not offer a comparable experience across platforms and seriously hurt my score of it,0
very bad appsometimes spotify will be in a numb condition it doesnt work and also the main drawback is that we cannot download any song we can only add it to favorites disappointed,0
excellent,1
grate service still cant get sertin songs same as apple,0
dude cool app but there is one problem that the adds are very frequent and annoying they are long beside that the app is pretty good,1
its free,1
good app but i canceled and am going back to pandora because i dont want to support joe rogan figure it out spotify,0
takes some getting used to as far as searching and saving but very user-friendly,1
no connection at all times even with 5 bars literally unusable edit was trying to listen to lore podcast and i have great news while spotify is still dogshit because it still wont connect i found pandora and it has the lore podcast and it works,1
playback always stopped suddenly,0
very bad it is not working when i m playing the song it is closing by itself,0
podcasts becoming a nightmare trying to get rid of podcasts on this app is ridiculous stupid things are all over the home page you can click not interested till youre blue in the face and ill just keep throwing up more spam casts,0
spotify has a extensive music library chances are if you want they have it  but there mobile set up is poor for any kind of customizing its extremely difficult to build a play list if you have a lot of music to add  and no way to simply remove a song from your playlist makes it very difficult to build your play list if you plan on listening to any music while your offline or out of service areas,0
uninstalled after struggle search is working only when connected to wifi ive reported issue on playstore twitter and email but no proper response and issue is not fixed for months,0
songs all are better but they dont give importance to kannada songs like other language songs so thats why i am giving 2 star,0
you cant pre listen to the songs anymore,0
stop adding random trash songs in my playlist and play the ones that i added ffs,0
i love this app no problem about ads because it gives 30 min of uninterrupted music also very frequently ,1
bes sagat mcm blh buat,1
hate the new widget thats a 4x2 vs the older but better 4x1 the new one just takes up to much space on the home screen,0
good selection of music and works with all my devices,1
constant crashing currently its been crashing a lot more i have been a long time spotify user and i hope they fix it soon once they do get to fixing it its a 55 stars,0
love it wouldnt use any other music streaming service as long as i have spotify,0
hey guys im disappointed the app was great before the changesnow the app is doing its own thing i cant play the actual song i want pls do something before i try another app,0
why is it crashing so much ,0
frequently pauses and plays again for no reason about every minute until it finally stops playing just started happening in the last week makes listening very frustrating glitchiest app i have every used,0
easy to use love it,1
best music app more worth of it cost super high resolution audio with best recommendation albums i love it,0
very good app to hear music,1
some other malawian i am a malawian by the way so some other malawian songs can not be found on this but i love the fact that you provide so many albums of those that you are able to,1
not great for the listener itll randomly undownload all your albums or if you go offline not load them at all and this app shafts their actual creators by paying them fractions of pennies,0
i think its the best app for listening music  i really like it so much ,1
my spotify app keeps on interrupting music esp when i use it outside what could be the problem,0
the best music app i have heard of here you can make your own playlist just fab,1
love it i have used spotify for years and wont change i love the layout and ease of use i love the recommendations very good,1
bugs bugs and bugs play bar disappears 10x a day unable to play downloaded music when offline horrible ux hey spotify is it really so hard to make something thst works,0
what wrong with your update we cant even play the music that we really want we have to play most of the music before we can play the music that we desire and whats more you cant next after six try omg nice nice super super annoying,0
the app used to feel sluggish and slow scrolling through my playlists would sometimes lag on my main phone this has been fixed the performance of the app itself is much better right now i am loving it again good job,1
something went seriously wrong in the last update if your music gets interupted by other media the audio gets detached from spotify and continues but does not show in android or spotify anymore,0
i love the music memories of the past,1
great app but to many ads on free version,0
messing up a duo plan is kinda annoying to fix but its a good service,1
by this latest updateall of my created and favorite playlist and most of all important liked songs are gone now from my library now nowi am not seeing them anymore and even my own created playlist i have to search them like another user  and all of these things sucks  spotify team plz help me to find my memories in these lost playlists,0
very goodgood songs,1
im using spotify premium and its always a good experience animations on the app are cute too  this has been my necessity app haha whenever i get a new device it needs to have spotify,1
huge library of songs and a lot of artists i enjoy use spotify as their main source of media it isnt as good as youd expect if you dont have premium but you still get to make your own playlists and can play while using other apps thank you for making music accessable to me easily,1
i should look into getting something better to listen to music on but spotify is easy it is also riddled with ads seemingly designed to infuriate me and pays artists pennies if i could give it zero stars i would,0
great to find albums and songs that a person cant find anywhere else not even on youtube,1
spotify has a great selection of music,1
bugs out constantly stops playing music randomly for no reason no longer works with my smartwatch the whole interface is an absolute mess could really use some cleaning,0
spotify is great,1
very disappointed that im no longer able to add full albums to my playlist only can add individual songs same with queuing songs,0
its crashing everytime i play something,0
like everyone else after this past update my musics pausing mid-song and spotify doesnt show up on my lock screen while im playing it so if it pauses i have to search back up what i was listening to in order to play it again ive made it consistently 15 songs in before it shuts off and its getting on my nerves every time i restart it please fix this,0
paying for duo but the second person cant get anything to play  has to constantly login not good enoughdo better problem now solved working well ,0
amazing periodt,1
as a musician i love to listen to new sounds and different artists spotify gives me just that,1
its awesome and i love the interface very easy to use,1
great service to discover new music based on your tastes,1
very good music app and the sound quality is great too,1
best app to play song i am given this app 4 stars because in this there is the best song what ever songs we have heare we can listen songs from this app and 1 stars - because of ads,1
live this app i can play stations or set it on what artist i want to play never disappoints,1
i would like to cancel my subscription but i cant so why are you scamming meee fix this please,0
not working after latest android phone update no playlists and i cannot play any music the only solution provided by spotify is to remove the sd card this works but then also removes all my local audio files spotify needs to fix their continuous issue with sd card usage otherwise there is no point in paying premium for this piece of sh,0
genre tab in liked music is broken,0
the app keeps losing connection so it cant skip or stop songs,0
sounds good,1
really good app for latest as well as old times songs i and my mom both spend much time on the app as it really contain some good playlists ,1
i love the app very easy to operate but i cant download and doesnt stream music,0
this app is ruined now i pay a subscription for the app to randomly crash songs to play with no sound and have to be restarted i listen most days and i cant remember the last time i played a play list and didnt have to unlock my phone to restart the app or go back on to figure out why the music stopped,0
amazing cant think my life without it,1
soo great app but one problem its the fact that when we add new songs to playlist there is a recommend section when we wanna know how the song sounds like you can just hear to a little part of the song i dont know if is just for mebut it aint working it was a great feature pleasejust please bring it back,1
love this app im a big fan of harry potter and unfortunately after i finish one of the books the podcast shutsdown i dont know if it happens because i dont have the premium version beside that everything is good,0
not able to listen already downloaded music while using the app on the phone when listening on the tablet no problem same account,0
way too much restricting i cant no longer play my favorite songs a lot of times its because its playing a different song i dont like please i need you to make another update that is better,0
one of my favourite app ever coz i used ganaa and saavn but nothing can give the satisfaction coz the ad experience was very bad now i used the spotify and its very good now thank you spotify ,1
very good app so many songs available thanks,1
some horrible things are going on in this past update will reconsider service if these bugs continue way too many stops ui issues slow loading and playback issues for a paid service even while using downloaded music,0
love this app for my samsung watch it sometimes crashes but overall works like spotify on your phone,1
i cant play my own music from my phone unless downloaded songs why,0
i love this app i put it on when doing the housework and sing away makes cleaning and tidying the house so much more enjoyable,1
spotify used to be so good but they keep making changes like adding features and taking them away right after i adjust to them the group session is handled worse than before swiping no longer adds to queue and i have to do a lot of work to view songs by artists instead of listing all artists in my liked songs like before its so frustrating,0
bro remove the suggested song its so annoying,0
spotify for me is like the no app that i use to listen to music especially during my studies,0
why tf i always have to listen teri chaand baaliya every time in first ad its like i had listened it for 1000 times till now,1
it is glitchy sometimes plays without the player window but the reason why it gets 1 star the app itself is because when i get out of the car it waits until my hands are full and full sun on the cell phone until it inexplicably starts playing again it happens every time and i am sick of it the blackness of my phone in the sunlight while im wearing sunglasses and i have to maneuver the things in my hand around to lift my sunglasses to squint at my lock screen open that then close spotify,0
its been like a year and a half since i doawnload spotify at first it was amazing unlimited skips no shuffle play you can skip mins or secs in a song and rarely ads but now every 2 songs theres an ad only 6 skips an hour just to get the same songs all the day cant skip mins or secs on playstation its incredible because we still have the ability to skip etc its still a great app but we need more of the accessibilies that premium has,0
thats was so good,1
update - spotify is back working fine old news - been subscribed to spotify for a long time now but the latest update doesnt allow the app to work continuous to crash upon opening hoping for a solution soon thank you,0
105 professional spotify dickrider here i come in my pants every time i open the app,0
this is just disgustingi mean i cant listen any of my favourite songs without premium accountswhythis is not doneif you want to listen songs for free then this is not a good app for thattoooo disappointing,0
great customer support my app wasnt functioning at all after an update  i was very dissapointed after a couple of emails it was solved seems to have been a glitch with my sd card  now its working again  my sanity has returned after 10 years of using spotify this is the only problem i have had  it has been resolved swiftly thank you,0
so i have the family pack which allows up to 6 devices and when i go to download my play list it says to many devices  we only use 4 so i log everyone out and still same problem fix it now or loose a long time subscriber,0
the podcast section is horrific constantly starts podcast entirely over with no warning skipping the ads experiences terrible as it will go back to the previous clips unbelievable to me that an audio streaming app has such a bad audio streaming experience makes it almost unusable to listen to long-form podcasts,0
get localised advertisement even while paying for premium,0
how you guys didnt even notice that the logo is little bended towards right and and 2nd line is unequal overall for songs and podcast its my favourite app to use simple clean and more varieties,1
maganda,1
if theres one thing in life ive always hung onto its my spotify premium i cant live without it,0
its annoying why dont i have access to spotify canvas,0
im happy with the recommendations theyve suggested cuz its hard to find new bands  music with 1 company owning all the stations pretty easy,1
please fix this app sometimes i choose to play a song then it plays something else,0
uninstalled this app after using it for years all the sudden when i turn my screen off the app acts like i have low signal or dead ear buds nothing has changed on my end but there was an update recently going with pandora now hope they can keep it running right bye spotify,0
satisfying and entertaining and also a relaxing school of learning,1
this app continues to fail i have to either force stop and restart or uninstall and re-install it to get all functions to work i use it to listen to podcasts it has the best array of my preferences but i get disappointed every night when i turn it on again using my partners device does exactly the same thing,0
super easy and every song ive ever liked,1
i used to like spotify but the shuffle mode i dont like and i used to have it repeat but now i cant i like the older version so ill give it a 2 star,0
i have been experiencing downloading over mobile data issue for 1-2 years now i have done everything to fix it i went through every single troubleshooting step with spotify support team i even replaced my phone with a different one and the issue continues the problem is only ever solved temporarily then comes back and i lose data and therefore money,0
such an a amazing app for any day of week make me feel like in a movie,1
garbage just straight trashcan dl it for rogan and the majority of the time it doesnt load the podcast at all then when it does itll play whatever episode it wants  it happens on both my phones z fold 2 and s20 both 5g sooo annoying update still sucks 1272021 52621 still garbage 102721 still trash 11121 went to commercial 3 times in 10 min and started the episode from the start after every time update 11022 still trash it wont load the right episode fold 3,0
good app but if only you add the select button without being needed to remove songs one by one thank you,1
add ability to better control volume when playing to alexa speaker groups with multiple echos devices stop paying for joe rogans misinformation,0
where ever i go if it goes to school to showering i can always listen to the song podcast and more,1
its really good but the problem is my cousin always wants to play alot of songs with bad words and i dont like itand its also discusting,0
my fav app i use it the most out of my all apps  its not perfect - no i would have few recommendations how to make it better - but out of all music apps - it is the most accurate ,1
i enjoy romantic music it brings back good memories of love with men and l let the music move my emotions thru me,1
been using premium for just a few months and i am very happy with my purchase and i have the duo account me and my friend enjoy sharing our playlist would recommend to any music lover,1
opens to a black screen on android 12 then crashes reinstall didnt fix the issue,0
excellent love my access to joe rogan this an edit to my review i have really enjoyed this app one of the best music and podcast apps ive used but if spotify continues down this censorship path they are starting on i will cancel my paid account and delete it i am 5 star satisfied but if a minority of people are able to get them to act un american im out and ill take my money with me,0
worst platform to listen to podcasts on it will forget where you were and start at the very beginning even if you saved it to your episodes it still somehow forgets it goes through a forced ad even though you pay for premium it will forget where you were and start the podcast from the beginning saved the podcast for later too bad it still forgets and starts from the beginning close the app and open it an hour later still forgets the podcast and starts from the beginning,0
spotify has been the best music app i have ever encounterd the app consume less data and it is very enjoyable,1
no option to stop music keeps playing in background where is the play button,0
limited selection of music not as many of my favorites available huge amount of ads,0
im old school and like spotify for playing different kinds of music for me ,1
i honestly have a very hard time believing that this app could actually be as terrible as it is i am completely blown away that an app as huge as this can be the most glitchy pos on the entire app store catalog hands down every developer at spotify should be fired asap if not before,0
works fine most of the time,1
the music choices are vast and quality is awesome,1
i added some downloaded apps to a playlist but it cant be played offline,0
always a great playlist,1
i like it you can also set your alarm to a lot of things even podcasts and more,1
love spotify it is worth every penny i like that i can take my music everywhere i got with no enteruptions you can find all kinds of stuff in the app to not just music,1
its very easy to use and love the end of the year thing,1
very good,1
the app has starting issues sometimes i have to close and reopen the app even twice at times i would appreciate if swipe to queue were added the same way it is in ios i really like the app tho,0
hi just wanted to say i love the app but today i got a new device and tried to transfer everything when it came to my spotify i cant get my paid membership wha can i do about this thanks,0
got hit by the reset and delete bug that spotify refuses to admit exists woke up this morning without music because i had to log in to spotify breaking my google assistant morning routine would discover shortly after leaving later that day that all of my downloaded music for offline listening had been deleted along with all my settings i have a premium account a paid account with spotify and this is what happened not the first wont be the last,0
spotify is great app music is great too many ads tho i would recommend mutify if you cannot afford spotify premium,0
good just wish for some feature stability for example sliding to the right to add to queue doesnt work in the liked songs listing or in the search results listing also when searching for sth itd be great to have the liked and saved stuff show up first but thats complaining on a very sensitive level great app overall,1
the app is rlly good the thing is that every time a song ends 2 30s ads come up and another thing is when i play my playlist it plays a random song that isnt even on my playlist please fix that i just wanna listen to songs in my playlist not random songs,0
could you please stop asking me about accessing bluetooth devices im a paranoic i wont let you and im certainly not charging my mind if you ask me two hundred times a day,0
good app but there is some music that you dont get,1
after the last update the songs keeps stopping,0
a1 song app ever seen it its like gajab amazing,1
love the app but slow at opening,0
bad lyrics poor sound quality,0
best music software yet,1
the whole thing which you have to pay for premium and not get advertising is great but for one problem everytime you want to listen to a podcast you get advertising please fix this problem the music you get no advertising with premium,0
i played the list of songs that i added to my favourites but this app played other songs too that are not in this list please fix this,0
wow,1
good app yet recently ive noticed that alot of my songs are being removed for some reason would like to know why please,0
lovely place to listen to all different artists and genres of music update thanks for fixing it ,1
spotify is evil its owned by the music industry this is their way of paying the artist they already barely pay even less and dont forget the crumbs that they pay the artist from spotify is still 75 their so when they pay an artist a dollar the artist gets 25 cents and they keep the rest spotify is the most disgusting thing these greedy record companies could come up with they already rape their artist and take all the money they make in exchange for doing nothing at all,0
too much ads,0
very very practical easy controls as well,1
i downloaded spotify specifically to listen to the science vs podcast due to spotifys stance that it is taking with joe rogan and the spreading of misinformation i am now removing the app for my phone,0
way too many addsget like 3 songs then 20 min of addsboof,0
cant play money by lisa in most of my playlists because it was replaced by another song and many already reported this incident but its been two days no responseaction from spotify,0
this is best music app which song i want to search from youtube now i search form spotify the best thing is this i can listen every bts song so that ,1
it will not let me search for anything constantly says check you internet connection when im on wifi or even using my mobile data,0
stop adding suggested songs i hate it all i want is to listen to a rickroll and i cant i have to listen to stupid songs fix this or im deleting spotify forever,0
spotify is a really good music apps but it has so many ads and you cant choose the song unless you have premium,1
when i go to my playlist on my phone it will always say something went wrong have another go can it be fixed please,0
fantastic easy to use and making a playlist is simple,1
please fix the issue with the repeat function never working i set a song to repeat for my son but it never works this is even after numerous force closings of the app which still doesnt fix it,0
i have premium spotify and have for a while now im going to delete it all together as you cannot preview the song before adding it to your playlist why did they delete it there was no issue with it beforehand stupid,0
dope af big fan of spotify ive had premium and its awesome but even the free version is awesome,1
very restricting it makes me wanna pay for premium but i dont want to if u dont have premium theres alot u cannot do it is not enjoyable its frustrating it makes me feel forced to pay for premium not like before theres no 6 skips per hour and before u can play your liked songs in whole version before it was all good ive used this for a year and half now but ill stop now cuz its very restricting,0
absolutely the worst app i have ever had shuts down in the middle of podcasts just randomly starts playing a different podcast while i am listening to another one just junk,0
easy to navigate media control features work easily like the dark mode appearance,0
it is super good i really recommend this app but why 4 stars i love it but i think that it gives too many ads,0
almost everything is now a premium feature you can hardly do anything but i still like listening to music with the app,1
somethings wrong with my spotify my downloaded music stops playing when i listen to it offline it only lasts for 10 minutes,0
used to be perfect until i updated the app since then it wont work with my mobile data until i connect via wifi its been the same since then,0
my experience with spotify is great i love this platform thanks spotify team,1
theres some issue in the new version i suppose its not showing the song which is being played the complete tab is missing we cant either pause or goback or go to next song have to close the tab and start the app again n again fix this one,0
if not for the amount if humongous ads for premium the app is best for itself,0
duscustang you can not change while listening to a song and you cant pick a specific song it has to be shuffled,0
the straw that broke the camels back was spotify deciding that every time i get in my car or my wife takes it out and my phone sees the vehicles bt that i should get an unstoppable push notification asking if i am going for a drive and suggests playlists features come and go constantly and ive experienced intermittent bugs or for all i know features that make the app frustrating to use but at least until the last few days i didnt have to worry about the constant annoyance notifications,0
i am editing this review i earlier rated it 5 but now after you know which updates i am rating it what it deserves,1
love this app but yesterday when i tried streaming the songs it didnt play when i switched from my wifi to mobile data it started playing please fix this problem,0
i love creating my own playlist listening to oldies rb rap house music,1
i listen to my son mobbo rawbo and the cool thing as his music continues to play in the algarythem and he receives compensation for his music neverending runs cool very cool mom it is a really excellent app very very good better playing on spotify than anyother ytube is ytube but spotify is special just the way it is set up and i dont mind paying any type of monthly fee or whatever ya know what i mean thank you spotify for bringing my sons music to me and the world,1
great app user friendly and helps you find good new music as well,1
it randomly stops playing usually when my screen times out also the banner for the song im listening to doesnt show so i cant skip or pause and to stop the app i have to force stop it by closing down the whole app,0
have found virtually everything i have looked for and thoroughly enjoyed the listening experience the play lists put together for me by spotify have been spot on and a delight to be able to listen to old favorite music,1
use any music app you want to but sooner or later you need to come here on spotify because there is nothing better than this ,0
the app is great but sadly if you dont have premium you cant play what songs you want,0
good quality music quick and easy,1
dum dum and i wanted to play a specific song and it gives me a whole random playlist which sucks at least have a setting or something developers  geez now i have to use youtube music ,0
not possible anymore to playstop go to next or previous song worked before just fine thanks to updates i might need to cancel the premium because of this,0
my biggest complaint is the fact that there are many moments where you need internet just to access your downloaded podcast episodes if i have no internet the your episodes page will just load and spin giving you a message telling you that there is no internet connection other than that the app works perfectly and its very intuitive,1
good app wish it had an eq only had to reinstall twice to fix an issue in the 5 years or so ive been using it,0
love this app so many great songs here,1
very good app it deserves five stars  its a good music app probably the best and has no problems there isnt any ive seen actually,1
i lost my spotify premium out of no wherei tried contacting spotify though email but they never got back to me i had over 3 months of premium individual and i kept my payments on time then all of a sudden it ends after i get charged for it what a waste of money,0
a good choice for listening to music but has a ton of issues from amount of ads to randomly crashing now it seems the apps going downhill fast but its still not bad in my opinion,1
spotify has such a wide range of musical tastes and artists that its impossible not to find what you want to hear on spotify they cater to all kinds of tastes and musical interests and all types of listening attitudes spotify is the one for me,1
app consistently closes by itself just after opening it nearly every time for the last week please update,0
i love it best experience so far for 2 years now,1
i love it this app have every song and its so chill and relaxing,1
my experience is goodi listen songs app quality is best ,1
been using it for a week now and am enjoying it a lot im using it without a subscription and have no commercials so far i hope that when it happens its a reasonable amount and everything still works as it has been,1
fantastic  no complaints what so ever keep it up you guys ,1
awesome music but could have been better like youtube music,0
ok app with free and amazing app with premium few bugs with spotify connect but overall its the best system for speakers that support it,1
anytime i connect my galaxy buds the app stops playing randomly or pauses no use relaunching,0
love the music  easy to navigate,1
i mostly use the app for exclusive podcasts like jre and appreciate spotify as company as a whole but the app crashes all the time frequently when i go to listen to a podcast the podcast doesnt come up so if it has video i cant see it or skip ahead or go back within the podcast its as if the app doesnt register its playing if the app was more reliable i would like consider using it for music and upgrade to premium account but the frustration isnt worth it,0
glitching its worked perfectly until this month now it wont let me pause or skip it doesnt show up as playing but the sound continues and have no way of stopping it other than switching my phone off then on shame really because it was a great app please fix the problem,0
recent update is causing so many issues the song thats playing will stop being accessible at the bottom of the screen and the app has to be closed and reopened for a chance to make it work again,0
what a song recommendations amazing ,1
the app on my phone doesnt work anymore after the recent update it says my playlists are empty and i cant play any music or podcasts at all it works fine on my laptop though i pay premium and i cant use the app anymore coooooool fun i love it c fix it asap,0
app is trash company business practices are trash good algorithm but thats not worth more than a star,0
i dont mind the ads ive long since become used to it but its just so loud the normal music im hearing is like on low  medium volume then the ads come on and tries to break my eardrums really its like someone is talking normally next to you then suddenly a kid starts screaming loudly in your ear for a minute continuously,0
it was amazing and worth my time listening podcast using this app,1
fix your ui this left aligned nonsense is horrid,0
the new update will not let me listen to all my liked songs,0
very irregular quality when it comes to streaming music not worth the space on my phone when you take into consideration the filth that spotify relies on to make a profit,0
its not that bad except they force you into paying for premium by bombarding you with ads  its basically youtube strong arm tactics lighten up on the ads youre already filthy rich ,0
i love spotify i use to not be able to figure it out but now its super easy and i use this about 8 hrs a day for listening to music,1
this is so freaking bad i have tried to play the songs i want but it puts anyother song spotify is so overrated that was an year ago but now spottify is great i was just dumb im keeping it because its funny,1
its a good app for listening music but its too restricting when i play my fav song it automatically played another song which is not in my playlist,0
too many ads,0
i hate the updated spotify cause i cant choose what music i want to play it just randomly pick its own i hate this,0
pretty good like the recommendations but now my playlists are buried under other stuff unless i click for only my composed playlists i do love some of the suggestions made by spotify,0
its good until it stops giving you the 30 minutes ad free,1
this is so amazing app i have no words to say about this app,1
why do i pay for a subscription when the app constantly glitches  cancelled,0
spotify is dishonest 1 ads are played more than advertised 2 song skips are less than advertised 3 small selections in playlists are replayed continuously omitting the rest over long periods 4 unwanted songs are infiltrated into playlists and form part of the skipping restrictions i dont mind ads spotify needs these to earn from non-subscribers i no longer consider to subscribe from a dishonest company i boycotted itunes netflix is now suffering as will spotify good luck,0
excellent music app,1
i love the selection of playlists and being able to build my own,1
they are shutting down free speech there are programs they dont have anymore silencing people is not right everyone has a opinion opinions deserve to be heard this app is a joke i will be going somewhere else,0
easy to use artist you love easy to find streaming is a real great experience,1
nice,1
app usually works great but lately it crashes every few minutes when in the background since this is a paid service i would hope for a slightly better experience then this but i cant complain too much,0
i bought premium and my downloaded videos wont play,0
let the app keep the phone unlocked while playing or im not resubbing its dangerous while driving otherwise and it used to do this,1
it used to work fine but all of a sudden stopped playing any songs whenever i try to play any music the app closes by itself i mean whats the point of i can only browse through songs without playing,0
since the last update this morning my music is breaking up and upsetting me frequently it used to be my only lovely company prior update and never let me down i am a premium user,1
i use the app for podcasts every 5 to 10 minutes th podcast stops playing part way through a podcast the podcast will stop and change to another episode good app but annoying sometimes,0
its honestly great ever since i bought premium,1
so far i love  spotify all other music apps arent worth using  really  yes,0
can you please stop playing music automatically everytime i connect my device on bluetooth all the settings from my phone ia set to not do it but this app ia very insistent very annoying and frustrating why dont you have stop button on your app only play and pause,0
buggy as always player screen not avilable unable to stop playback,0
i love how easy it is to use and truly you can get any song i love it ive tried baby other apps and this is by far the best,1
for me as a computer science student this app is very motivating because it shows that you dont have to be a good developer to be successful,0
2024        shuffle      shuffle  extra             2019                              ,1
constantly bugging out cant have playback bar for more than one song touch controls from earbuds have stopped working cant stop music from playing unless you close the app spotify has been around far too long to still be this sloppy,0
they will not allow you to add your music from the memory card for free,0
very good music player perhaps the best but the fact you need premium 10 bucks to turn off shuffle is unnecessary and greedy,0
it seems everyone is experiencing the same issue as i am sometimes the controls for the song playing randomly disappear and the music will stop randomly too i have to completely exit and close the app re-load it and then it works then the problem starts again in 5-10 minutes very annoying i think the update caused the app to glitch,0
like the content app now crashes often content stops randomly or the app doesnt completely open allowing the user to use the controls,0
really defeats the purpose of spotify if yo unable us to hear bit of the song before adding it to our playlist ,0
i love spotify and do t know what id do without it,1
u cant turn shuffle off of like song playlist,1
album artwork not showing on galaxy watch only when app is uninstalled very strange,0
love using spotify for whatever i like to listen to everything about it is amazing no faults,1
the app is great but sometimes im indecisive of what i want to listen to i just want to listen to something can you maybe add a button like the one netflix has surprise me or something that would be really great especially if it plays something related to the kind of music we listen to wonderful app nevertheless,1
its not opening in my sharp 5 everytime i tried to login it says something went wrong in email facebook and sign up form,0
good application,1
it will not work half the time and when i try it my phone stop working it use to work but now it dosent,0
such a horrible user experience the app didnt even have the button to close the current music for last 3 days m not getting the button to play any song when i tap on it it just play the highlight of the song i cant see the queue as well unistalling ,0
just great,1
app crash when playing music again does this always happen for vivo user,0
it has every i like in a way that is easy to access,1
the ui is amazing the font is just beautiful the library is large enough that im not missing any songs my only complaint is the regional restrictions on music i need my anime songs edit changing my 5 stars to 1 bring back the shuffle button,1
this app is very good i always go to it when i want to listen to music the only problem isunless u have premium when u want 2 put on just one song it plays a selection so i only listen to playlists,1
if this app isnt reopened every time after i pause it the songs are glitchy and pause themselves if i go to the app i cant even see if it is playing a song no skip and no song shown playing fr if its not one thing its the next,0
nice,1
i love it all my music when i want it,1
its very chil,1
good app however after pausing the song a usual swipe in the notification bar would clear the background running of spotify which isnt happening anymore is there any resolve to this bug,0
the app has been glitching out a lot more recently itll try to play over other things on my phone it wont show the options to pause or skip a song i findyswlf closing and restarting the app multiple times a day,0
its a really good app i can easily find the songs i need and want to listen too the only thing about this app is that you need to upgrade to premium to remove adds which in my opinion is kind of a money wasting thing but in all the adds dont really bother me its just thag you have to upgrade to remove them,0
hey its very good but the lyrics of korean bengoli or other songs why are not in hindi or english please fix it i cant understand lyrics and ads but over that all things are superb,1
nice ap just these ad intrupts a lot first it was fine 30mins 1 ad but now after every 2-3 songs there is a ad,0
this app helps to release my stress by listening to wonderful song selection,1
plays random rubbish slow to learn old fashioned no voice control,0
it is very helpful to find your favorite songs and you do not have to listen to ads at the beginning or in the middle of every song,1
great  but ads very tension ,0
its great all the music i could ever wish for,1
very good an army can listen every song,1
great ability to explore music without being diverted or distracted,1
great music and friendly user loving it,1
first off i hate when it adds songs to your playlist i honestly think it is annoying and when i removed those then it recommended songs and i wanted to listen to 1 song in the playlist but when i clicked play it played take on me by 80s super hits so annoying just let the playlist creator add songs you do not need to spotify but it is a good app so 2 stars edited terrible app i really should uninstall like seriously spotify i wanna listen to one song but i cannot bc you add,0
best music app ive seen no stress to use and it comes with lyrics so you can be sure to sing along,1
the login experience of the app on android is very poor i have been trying to log in to the app since the last 30 minutes it keeps getting times out faced the same issue last time and ended up creating a mew account,0
great app continues to give great recommended songs on premium transitions feel professionaly mixed and premium is so worth it,1
can only pin 4 playlists limited sorting options in general play bar is gone now,0
ads are too many too often and too long very annoying and you cant fast forward thru the commercials,0
removed pawan kalyan tholiprema album etc,1
this app is good i dont know why there is no older songs like 80-90s songs and famous songs like boys visvasamsivaji movies and so on so pls add some tamil songs from 2000-2021 and also recent movies songs,1
the best music app ever  i love it,1
love it all my music and podcasts are here they are the best,1
outstanding service to me my playlist will blow your mind omg ,1
ui is broken after update app will continue play through phones speakers after bluetooth device has been disconnected does not display player button nor allows access them while music is playing,0
getting rid of podcasts because people dont agree with certain politics isnt what i paid for rogan shouldve moved onto a private server everyone else should see that it starts with the big podcasts and works its way down,0
currently the navigation bar is missing when playing content unable to pause etc,0
this app has changed my whole life it is so good for when you go for a run extthere are barely any adverts and you dont neex internet to play,1
the new update does now allow android auto to retrieve my music i usually could manually overide by starting the music on my phone vs using the car interface but the new driving mode doesnt respond when i press play or on a specific song title to get it to play please fix,0
thanks to the most recent update spotify is now perfect i can now clear the app and the music will still play also if i clear all my apps then connect my phone to my cars blu tooth the music will start without me having to re open the app this was my only complaint about the app before and now its perfect 100010 would recommend,1
just loving it seems like it just made for meit have many options also like the time capsule and also shows the current trending famous indian and international so i can easily get the name of the song which where famous and trending in the apps like instaand short videos appbest app i ever saw it would be like a cherry on cake if it can give free downloading on songsbut what to do bcoz it is impossiblei hope that it could be possible one day,1
unable to view or play my downloaded episodes unless i have wi-fimobile data enabled if i am on a plane and i want to switch podcasts i cannot even when its downloaded,0
excellent amazing range of music truly fantastic experience,1
why the hell there is a hidden option in search it is not showing the song if it is hidden,0
awesome music player ,1
not working well after latest update i have the same problems as everyone else,0
im paying for premium but im getting 30 second ads on podcasts theyre unskippable also multiple instances of spotify run on my now playing list in the notification bar app often pauses while playing through downloads and wifi the now playing bar no longer shows up,0
didnt like the new update i cant even put a song on repeat anymore its all on shuffle mode and i dont enjoy it im switching over to pandora until they fix this,0
i just pulled spotify back up and am blown away by the amount of commercials and the poor music choices you really have no value offer just more commercials will push me to not use it like i stopped using the radio,0
a very good app but when i see why premium there is mention you can download songs and no use of wifimobile data but there is no download option plz update this bug and ill give 5 stars,0
i have heard the same commercials 12 times in one hrsame ones over and over getting tired of hearing the same,0
some songs i search up and try to play it comes up with a completely different song,0
ive never used the free version but premium is great no challenges just bugs here and there they got fixed by the spotify team anyway thanks guys keep the updates coming,1
this is an outstanding service with the most integrity of any app i have used the rest of tech needs to promote freedom of thought and speech we are humans inspired by logicical thought not animals seeking survival instincts thank you for being real grateful for truthful policy,1
the amount of ads on this app is terrible at first it used to be one ad but now i get 5 in a row not to mention i barely 30 minutes of ad free music anymore which only adds insult to injury i would give it zero stars but thats not possible so i give it a one,0
awesome great music,1
basically can find any song youve heard on this app and add it to your playlist its great ,1
why cant i log in with my phone number i sure as hell didnt forget my phone number that i need to check it everytime,1
very useful app for my watch as we can browse thousands of songs on watch itself,1
great music listening app it can be buggy from time to time but ive had issues for awhile videopodcast interface could better like have audio only mode and scheduled downloads for new episodes,0
music stops and plays after latest spotify app update on samsung galaxy note 20 ultra 5g music seems to now stop and play with no reason music downloaded phone software upto date solid internet connection bluetooth headphone upto date never had this issue before recent update restarted phone and still no luck even reinstalled spotify not worth paying for premium with problems like this rather use youtube which wouldnt have this issue,0
way too many ads like 3 ads in-between each song its ridiculous really not to mention they are incredibly annoying ads also paying 10 a month is not worth it there are movietv streamers that charge less than that,0
ive had no problems with this app until recently it started to randomly shut off and the last couple of months its become more recent i thought perhaps there was an update needed but there isnt one available this has become very frustrating and inconvenient im on the verge of canceling my subscription soon,0
why why why why does spotify keep deleting my saved songs on my sd card,0
great for any type of genre of music n has alot of options to suit ones taste,1
good app overall frequent updated to clean up bugs is nice,1
this app so nice good job vow tq for your best but telugu lyrics not come tamil and this app produce many many ad so that my angryness problem,0
great app love everything about it and at a great price for premium,1
only option it gives to listen to albums is on shuffle and at that it doesnt play some of the songs in the album it play songs from other albums i dont want to listen to every song on shuffle i want to listen to the album from start to finish from songs in order and when youre listening to an album it doesnt show you all the songs and i may just give you the option to listen to them on shuffle,0
i never have a problem they play the artists i love to hear,1
the latest update makes the app crashes everytime i open it needs to be relaunched everytime ,0
best experience nice quality,1
app is working good nownow i can found my all favorite song,1
leave it alone everytime you update it it quits working i pay for premium but after this latest update i cannot get anything to load fix it or when its time to renew for my year in may i may have to find a new streaming platform,0
all autoplay is disabled and car mode set to neverdisabled yet every time my phone connects to my vehicle spotify launches because it isnt running at all and starts playing music,0
constantly crashing and playing the wrong song or podcast episode i choose i click on one song and it will cycle through others on the playlist or album and not even play whatever it lands on when it finally does play the right thing the time bar is either wrong or not moving at all,0
any way you look at it its a good app all the way around,1
love spotify been my number one used app for several years,1
its awesome it just sucks that u have to pay for it,1
without premium you cannot do many basic things and its very restrictive on what you can or cannot listen to for you cant just look up a song and listen to it without waiting or using your limited skips to find it that doesnt help find new creators because they allways play songs i already have heard,0
awesome music app my fave all time,1
mobile app is pretty ok the tv app is laggy,0
perfect,1
this app used to be great but in like the past year its gotten to where it doesnt load even songs that are downloaded wont load if you dont have internet connection i dont understand why im paying such a high fee n cant have my music and podcast,0
very good app for any other music  you can find what ever you like to look up,1
nice features easy to use price acceptable i do enjoy music with spotify ,1
latest update broke the app music stops playing all the time the play button controls dissapear i see other reviews saying the same thing im on android s10 and spotify premium if you fix it ill update the review been a long time spotify fan and this is the first time i have serious issues,0
ive been using spotify since it came out and have always prefered it over every other streaming service highly recommend to my friends and family and highly recommend giving it a shot,1
excellent quality great selection of music and podcasts although i have premium but still get adds on podcasts which is a bit annoying but otherwise really enjoy,1
while listening to music the songs would just pause randomly very frustrating idk if anyone is experiencing this problem,0
came here after 3 frustrating weeks of increasing bugs to see im not alone i already had the latest update and it still didnt work so uninstalled the app and reinstalled yesterday works perfectly now might have been helpful if spotify could have suggested this ,0
great app and untill recently id have given it 5 stars for it does exactly ehat i want it to do safly tho the newest update has caused me and a lot of others a miriad of issues songs that are playing not showing up not responding to imputs dragdown menu headphone buttons google assisstant even worse in carplay please release a bugfix update and ill be happy to change my 2 star to the 5 star it deserves,0
its a good app overall but i cant view songs in albums of artists edit 052922 ever since i got my new phone samsung galaxy a20 none of my playlists pop up or my liked songs my music is unplayable recently it started saying that i was offline when i wasnt i am extremely upset with the situation because music is my happy place and now i have to use amazon music which isnt as good as this app when i looked to see if my phone was compatible it said it was so whats with that,0
i like that you can make your on playlist,1
awesome convenient and easy to access i have no issues at all with spotify,1
great experience but missed bengali osts for some great movies and also few old songs preferably source lyrics of regional songs in english so that everyone can read to give global reach to everyone,1
the music playing bar has disappeared as and i cant skip or pause my music its super annoying had been happening for a couple of months or more and is updated,0
consistly great all music quality is too notch and i thoroughly enjoy most of the recommendations the app suggest 5 stars,1
i dont know what happened but now it doesnt connect to the radio in my car half the time like it used to,0
great as long as you can cough up 10 bucks a month,1
none of my podcasts are playing at all my songs keep pausing at random times and then starting again i have spotify premium and even my downloaded songspodcasts arent working properly its not something wrong on my end because ive done everything i can think of to fix the problem i also looked up what might be wrong and apparently other people are having the exact same problem spotify better fix this i dont want to have to switch music apps but i will if this continues,0
the app has been very buggy lately i click on a song and the play bar doesnt show up all the time i constantly have to restart the app etc please fix your app,0
spotify tells that it gives 30 mins of ad free music but it gives ad after every 6-7 mins and now it contains sexual content too idk what are sexual audios doing in a music ap its disturbing when such cheap content pops up on the screen while searching for my fav songs your ads are very irritating i swear i know they are made to sound irritating i swear the voices get to my nerves so much,0
love all my playlist that spotify creates for me,1
i hate the new update not being able to pick what song comes on nor skip,0
love spotify always has what i need no matter my mood,1
censorship is rampant no matter your settings or subscription status not into kids bop radio,0
great music and podcast that i love,1
cant even play the song we want  you put that shuffle and play what they want you to hear ,0
its not good i pressed the heat waves and the song came out as hot road,0
theres a bug that ive been experiencing for over a month now when you play a song in a long playlist sometimes the volume will just turn low directly and sometimes the song just keeps playing in spotify but not in the background,0
has just about everything u can think of and easy to use,1
spotify has become my sole music player app because of the playlists i have made,1
nothing is comparable to this app whenever you feel whatever its always with you thanks for creating such a beautiful app that works with every emotion you have  love this app its the one which always with me ,1
recent update needs urgent bug fix control bar missing music glitches when i turn off phone screen or navigate apps and sometimes my phone will just start playing randomly now i dont know what you guys did but a quick fix would be to just restore an update to last patch love spotify but cant use or want to pay for an app like this,0
its a really good app for listening to music,1
idk if this is an update or what but suddenly i have a limit on how many songs i can skip what is this a technological dystopia i cant even play the freaking 2 minute song i want without paying what next we pay to open the stupid app what is this corrupt bs this is stupid and only backfires and companies only do this bs because theyre rich enough to i literally just want to listen to music and all i get is so sorry you werent satisfied but we actually dont care,0
i always had a good time with spotify until recent updates has removed my profile saved playlists and now not allowing to listen to songs of my choice unless i buy premium uninstalled now such a shame,0
cant listen to audio when adding songs to a playlist,0
pay for the family account and still only one person can use it pointless and waste of money and it has a mind of its own works on its own accord apple music is cheaper and you get a family package,0
player sucks service is ok,0
loving the variety of genres,1
great app with a diverse collection of music and audio,1
i love this app its very easy to use and the great thing i like about it is i can make my own playlist and access it at anytime its great this app is a keeper and i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to find a good app to play music listen to podcasts and even church services are a whole lot more love love love it thank you,1
since the update my vehicle new aftermarket stereos spotify bluetooth app doesnt connect i had to uninstall and find version 79 elsewhere and disable updates pls fix otherwise pretty happy with the app still the case 6 months later,0
i really enjoy this app i find something a little offensive though spotify how can you have a liquor advertisement in the middle of a macklemore album are you trying to tell a bunch of alcoholics to drink maybe that wasnt your intention but really to those people to find any reason to drink when an album is explaining how that will just mess you up its kind of conflicting,0
this app crashes several times a day and when an ad plays during a podcast it resets it back to the beginning honestly not sure whats happened to the developers of this app have they been replaced by toddlers update after a year still very very bad none of the the problems stated here have been resolved,0
great app just wish there were cheaper plans bc when your a kid and dont make bank and you want to listen to musicyou dont really have the funds to give up 10 dollars a monthi know it doesnt sound like a lot but if you think about it you not getting anything you are enjoying music and i guess you can just use the default like i do but it is just limiting the app itself is great and has huge options and good quality not glitchy and is great,1
i really enjoy it3 and with premium its perfect,1
it doesnt help put my newborn to sleep that the commercials are twice as loud as the calming music that was playing seconds earlier,0
absolutely love my spotify premium ,1
why theres alway trouble in offline mode i literally cant play downloaded songs whats the point of fkn offline mode if you still need a fkn internet connection ,0
tbh this was a great app but the number of recommended songs that come up when youre just trying to listen to your liked songs is extremely annoying like i get it we get to listen to new songs but i dont want 5 recommend songs coming up one after another and i dont like it or smth and cant skip songs at the end i just give up and go on youtube to listen to music,0
i use spotify for everything but i am quite disappointed not angry its a bit disappointed that you have to get premium to skip as much as you want and im also not big fan when you type in the song you have to go through like a whole playlist then you get your song like once i typed in the song and i had to wait like an hour till i could actually get the song that iwanted,0
since ive gotten premium whenever i close the app and come back lets say 3 hours later the timer says 3 hours over 3 minutes and when i tap play it skips the song it happens all the time with songs and podcasts also when i come back to the app and press play it plays for a sec and then stops requiring me to press play again,0
looses place and skips podcasts when adverts play every update i have to redo my settings to the way i want it to work a literally rock from the ground is a better podcasting platform,0
everything is good but whenever i try to search a song i get out of the app its so frustrating i am not even able to listen to a song i want and i am not sure whether the phone is hanging or the app is lacking,0
best music app ever i found music here for my every mood,1
i download podcasts because i have spotty connections so podcasts is in phone but if it tries to play an ad while i have a bad connection it hangs until i get a connection then plays the ad then it dumps the currently playing podcast loses its place meaning the podcast flips to viewed and progress bar is gone then starts a completely different podcast then im spending 5-10 minutes figuring out where i was in the original i love the podcasts this bug sucks,0
app has been good for the past year or so ive decided to re download it and get the premium account but it keeps crashing on me and not responding,0
great just that dont translate the lyrics some people just love to sing aite ,0
stop giving random songsgenres i dont like on spotify on my 3 hr long playlist just because i dont have premium please thanks,0
it is a amazing but the playlist i want is not available,0
all the music youll most likely ever need except fr or one spanish rock bands song i cannot find spanish as in spain between 1982-89,0
i love spotify forever,1
love it but group session doesnt work rn so sad ,0
describing my experience with spotify is not optional as far back as i can remember i used to think to myself why cant all music be free i mean everyone was holding the music hostage the record stores the recording companies the illuminati probably i mean those folks are just into everything finally this mr spotify comes along and does the right thing by making the music free just a few bucks per month and all the music is free way to stick it to the illuminati mr spotify,1
any app that doesnt bow to the liberal woke crazy left has to be good,0
it is always on i have to always turn it off,0
subscription is cheap love that you can download the music and listen to it while youre offline or out in the middle of nowhere,0
parents beware unless you pay for premium i really enjoyed spotify until an extremely inappropriate ad played while my children were listening i uninstalled it after that,0
the app crashes on my device too much it doesnt load i have a premium account but i m unable to access it from my phone please fix the issue,0
why am i shown ads when i have paid 799 rs for the whole year i know the purpose of advertisements but i really dont need it for gods sake,0
absolutely love spotify i use this app all day every day music is life ,1
first time using it love its variety and rich sound,1
music will not continuously play it pauses and resumes multiple times during each song during streaming play for no reason this occurs on all devices excluding my desktop looking for a new streaming service,0
continues to crash on my samsung 10 have to regularly uninstall and reinstall like ik doing now while i write this review,0
the app doesnt even work as it doesnt allow me to listen to the music i want to listen to but instead makes me listen to random songs ive never heard before most terrible and useless app i have ever seen and on top of all of this they prevent you from doing things such as skipping more than six times per hour and puting songs on repeat unless of course youre willing to pay youve lost a user since money is obviously more important to you than user convinience,0
well this was a good app at the start but then the new update came and i cant even choose what song to listen please fix it,0
something wrong with this app try to connect it on my tv and it takes forever i also need to uninstall it on my phone but doesnt help anyway whats wrong i hope you can fix this problem because its just a waste of money if you dont,0
in my opinion i think that spotify its the best app bc i can listen to music and i dont need to have my phone on,1
what the hell happened it feels like every other update creates a tonne of bugs play controls keep disappearing and audio will randomly start playing out of no where dont even get me started on the ads during podcasts even when im paying for a sub i understand you payed a metric boatload for joe rogan but i dont even like him and dont understand why i have to pay for that contract with a bunch of ads really sad to see whats happened,0
its where everyone should go for music nough said,0
spotify is amazing you will not regret subscribing and if you have older children who want it too the family plan is awesome highly recommend i have discovered so many artists from the recommended songs that start to play after the song you search for finishes,1
love all different kinds of music  you guys rock roll stay cool,1
i wish i started on apple music or yt music spotify shuffle plays the same songs all the time i have about 1000 songs and it always plays the same 50 on shuffle the push podcasts everywhere your feed is mainly podcasts the only reason i havent switched is because its hard to transfer so many songs to another platform,0
the best streaming service yet,1
very good app but too much ads,0
no matter what mood your in you can find the perfect song on spotify,1
doesnt load local files stored on the phone it used to but latest update beole it for android 9 users fix it,0
i really like using this but of recently ive not been able to pay for the premium package i want to but it keeps declining my card i would really like you guys to look into this,0
the last version from 2 weeks ago is full of critical bugs and wasnt fixed until now boo tidal seems closer than ever,0
data consumption has increased and ad every minute which is not good,0
spotify rules its so dam good,1
great app i enjoy the quality  it would be cool if we could downloud music and get ability to skip songs and play songs in a specific order i get they use premium for money but just do a no ads thing instead,0
been using for years and has always been an amazing app free or with the premium,1
money by lisa is replaced by a unauthorized song in todays top hit playlist this is happening in many other playlists too lisa fanbase are trying to reach spotify service but no one is answering because of this issue money dropped from global 200 today it is affecting the streaming number of the song too please fix this issue,0
great app i truly appreciate and enjoy it what a joy,1
favorite music app,1
too good,1
amazing app to listen song,1
i had to give one star cause i couldnt give zero  just get youtube music spotify has made everything premium you cant even rewind songs,1
the spotify feature in which the artist introduces their playlist to the listeners was availablebeforebut now its not i cant watch bts new interview video intro in spotifylike wth i want that feature ,0
my experience on my tablet cant be faulted however my experience on my smartphone has become frustrating because it isnt the same anymore when i initially downloaded app it was just like the tablet but now it has become frustrating  unusable because i cannot choice the tracks or songs easily its no longer track or song orientated but album orientated  i cannot select the tracks i want but instead get given random tracks can anyone suggest a fix so it the same as my tablets spotify,0
i can do the work but listen to it,1
the sound quality is vary good the adds are coming in 30 min and many more things nice work spotify ,1
recent update has made the app unstable the playing track isnt updating constantly crashes needs restart and randomly stops playing,0
lack of the ability to play music that i want everytime i say play new alternative music or anything in the similar music preferences it defaults to sure here is some 90s alternative and that is definitely not what i want to hear,0
the app wont let me list to my song in it own eney more change it back so i dont have to suffle my playlist,0
absolutely brilliant  thanks to spotify the song you can find are endless rarity the you cant buy from outlets well done im always playing my spotify when im working thumbs up ,1
i dont know whats going on with this app but im encountering so many problems now the player is not visible nearly all of the time which makes it very difficult never used to have these problems needs to be fixed for android users,0
guuude,1
im very excited and happy with spotify,1
spotify is a really good app cause you do not have to pay for the songs and thats why i like spotify,1
why cant i play radio songs lol i clicked a song and another started to play what is happening to this stupid app and add a quick playlist add button waste of money,0
spotify is good but yall do to many ads for a person try to listen to they music but yall just got way to many ads,0
many problems but gave 4 stars cause i can listen to kpop songs and you recommend me good songs of my choice 1 not proper lyrics in tamil 2 does not have lyrics for all songs and 1 feature i like is that the app has korean to english translation but i have seen this feature only in alcohol freetwice song hope that this feature will be available to all songs in future,0
over the last few years the app just seems to get more buggy as more features were added if you use android auto look for a better less buggy service audio catalog is still great,1
adds even when you listen to the this adds will provide you with 30minutes uninterrupted you get 3-4 adds every song,1
only app worth writing a review for almost perfect now provide a visualizer for playstation and xboxplease,1
ive had spotify since 2017 and to this day it is my favorite place to listen to music best selection of songs and easiest layout,1
thank ndlovu,1
glitches constantly pauses all the time def dont pay for a paid membership what a joke worst money ive spent this year fix your app spotify if i could give you 0 stars i would,0
ui is lo minimal and easy to use should give option to download songs individually,0
its all in all pretty good but it has its problems,0
has 9999 of songs youre looking for and if your favorite song is one of the 01 just download it onto your desktop open up local files on your spotify app and download it to listen to it on your phone,0
really like the app i have the paid for account and really like it some people said that it doesnt just stick with your playlist but that it plays other music but if you go to settings you can adjust all of that,1
very good,1
you are good but i think you need to improve on downloading system,0
i love using my spotify app on my chromebook it is way better than listening to youtube which has adds i do not own spotify premium and i never get adds i do have a couple of issues but i will keep my rating at 5 star my app just laggs a bit and only lets me play certain songs in my school district but other than that i love spotify definetly recommend,1
still my go-to music app but they have tripled in the amount of ads they use which is why i put three stars,1
excellent songs hilarious,1
i love spotify but lately for some reason its being extremely buggy,0
agree with the people complaining about the music suddenly stopping i tried everything and its still doing it its so annoying i am a paying member but am paying for something i cant use,0
this app is nice app for listening songs music i only like to listen songs on spotify,1
great music options great audio quality depending on output device but still over all really good except for one thing the fuction of using the phone as a controller for laptop consoles tvs etc is absolutley horrible i play a lot of video games on my computer so it being implemented so horribly affects me greatly since i cant always tab out to change songs some frequent problems are songs not skipping songs not playing and the wrong song being displayed if it worked solid 45,0
the app is not working whenever i try to play any music the app is just crashed or closed,0
new update breaks in-dash headunit functionality not happy,0
the song money by lisa on some of your playlists especially from tth and playlist with million followers has been replaced with an unauthorized song with an identical name we have been reporting about that through email twitterand instagram since april 24 and you guys still didnt fixed so disappointing,0
this app is really at a good position for music keep this process going and please make updates i have a small problem well when i save a song in my playlist it doesnt go there this is what my problem was so i started to use it from the liked songs menu but i highly recommend this app for your chill moody or any songs you like with head phones it has the best quality to listen overall i rate it a 5 star i hope this reaches over a trillion downloads thank you for your time ,1
app wont stop asking for bluetooth permissions i have no choice to say no i can only choose maybe later no i will not ever be granting you bluetooth permissions and if for some reason that changes i know where the settings menu is i powerfully dislike needing to push an extra button to access my music im about to cancel my subscription and find a new music provider spotify are you going to fix this yes maybe later,0
i love this app its a great music app and for spotify premium well its cheap and reasonable i have no problems with this app whatsoever except theres one problem every single song i play theres always a ad in the middle of it sure premium will help but i think spotify could do a bit better on that overall amazing app,1
i am so happy with the spotify music app to be honest i would be lost with out it,1
in the past when i would click add songs to my playlist i could preview the song so i had a rough idea of what it sounded like but now that feature has been removed and ive decided that im no longer going to use this music streaming service,0
its amazing how you can make a next song button not working after couple of quick song switches even though the one in the notifications works fine only top 5 songs of the artist isnt fine too,1
everything i need is right here fantastic except for the advertising ,1
theres just no substitute for listening to songs someone else already prepared for you,1
i use spotify all the time i love being able to hear whatever song i like at any given time its a wonderful app,1
good selection of a variety of genres of music,1
nice,1
excellent for making play lists while gaming my kd has never been better,1
it is amazing but sometimes it glitches and it is amazing if u add still with you by jk jungkook,1
only problem is a ton of ads ,0
every time i wanna play a song it plays the wrong song that i dont like please fix this,0
love me some spotify its great music great recommendations for great music  an its jus the best i love it,1
best music app ever,1
been using spotify for years great amount of metal music on there -,1
although a bother to buy prem still no other music app scratches spotify,0
been using this app for years with little trouble but recently they took away two very important to me features - sorting liked songs by any genre and letting me press shuffle play multiple times theyve separated shuffle and play in playlists for no reason and i have to switch playlists to restart a shuffle,0
continuously getting worse each update to the gui makes it harder and harder to find or organize any of my songs crashes and bugs are frequent sometimes forcing a reinstall just for the app to properly function has been this way for years and will probably remain this way due to the developers clearly disregarding the user experience with the idea that they have the monopoly on music streaming apps honestly the only thing this had over piracy was convinence and it lost that years ago,0
holy awful update batman it no longer shows the currently playing song effectively eliminating your ability to skip to the next song cant skip in the app or the lock screen cant even skip with headphones also the songs now automatically play over the speaker as soon as you remove headphones did they test this update at all before release time to roll it back,0
pushing the agenda they could have stayed neutral i am now cancelling my subscription,0
premium,1
the app is fine but its been 2 years and theyre still showing ads during podcasts to premium users if you want podcasts go elsewhere unless you dont mind ads despite paying over 10 canadian if you only want music the app itself is easy to use and pretty intuitive i found the ads excessive without premium but no where near as bad as youtube,0
what the is happening with this app the songs are playing very very half like what is going on you literally need to put shuffle on that i dont want too im just getting so angry i also updated it but still nothing happenedthis app has become very disgusting cuz now i cant play my favourite part of the song nor listen to it easily f- spotify you better reply plz plz fixx this,0
somethings really wrong with the app ive to close the app and open it again to play music im even having spotify premium and this things been happening since three four days just sort things out asap,0
spotify is the greatest app for music ,1
first of all it always shows that theres no internet connection all the time even though i have a good internet connectionto fix this problem i tried uninstalling and installing the app again but after i have tried to log in for hundred time but it keeps showing that i have entered the wrong password and that they have send a link on my mail but that link never works tooand i checked with my friends they have the same issue regarding the app showing no internet connectionplease look into it,0
same issues as most after this last update song stops playing randomly and have to reopen app to play again now playing bar disappears,0
virtually any song at my fingertips podcasts from my favorite creators and i can take them to have with needing internet to stream ,0
one thing please make it so that you always get asked if you really want to remove a song from your liked songs bc there has been so many occasions where i accidentally clicked on the heart and it messed up my order and its annoying also would be cool if you get the what are my friends listening to on mobile,0
pretty good but sometimes it deletes all my downloads when i dont have access to the internet eventhough its before the 29 days offline mode it happens usually when i restart my phone i use the external storage that is the sd card i encrypted my sd card and that is probably the problem i hope you fix it,0
been listening to spotify for a couple years now and the adverts are just a nuisance what is the point of a song then a minute of ads after each one bit of a money grab going on lately not impressed other than that its an ok app but going downhill as time goes on,0
all your listening needs are handy right at your fingertips,1
its easy to find music i just love it better than youtube,1
yeah good quality music would be good if my discover weekly actually pertained to similar genresartists that i listen to or follow,1
great music streaming app get the premium for no ads so worth it in my opinion,1
had no issues with this app for years being a premium user but now really struggling with it as someone else said before there is now no player so cant skip pause etc not sure if this is because im on a samsung galaxy as it does come back briefly if i restart my phone ,0
used to love this app but since they started forcing podcasts into the app without letting you removing the recommendation and the fing ai continue to offer me religious and explicit content i had to move to another app i was a paying customer and shame on you for taking a good music app and destroying the user experience there is a feature request for three years with literally thousands of upvote yo let people remove the podcast section or at least hide some of it recommendation,0
its easy and has wide varieties of music to listen i love it,1
music music and more music access possibly the most complete library of recordings known to mankind with spotify,1
like until the most recent update now i cant listen to anything pages playlists and searches wont load useless and frustrating what happened update theyve done a couple updates since ive tried reinstalling etc still useless and ive never heard back from support even more useless and frustrating the only saving grace is i found a different app that i actually like way better for podcasts but ffs i miss my playlists,0
when is the now playing bar bug going to be fixed can the update that introduced it be rolled back immediately please this is a very annoying issue especially for a paying subscriber it messes up integration with car speakers and all other devices very unhappy with spotify rn,0
i wish i can skip the songs unlimitedlyother than that its the perfect kinda app and love using itgives me some good vibes  thanks for the developers,1
dont use this bad app,1
no cause sometimes i just want one song but then they some me other song that i dont want i just want that song not these songs,0
i would love it if i could just play a certain song on repeat and not have to try and fail to just rewind back to it nice app otherwise and if its behind a paywall im not happy,0
i loved this app until it completely stopped working for me it wont open at all and i get a app is not responding message,0
good app but i dont know why i cant play a certain music whenever i click on a song another song will play this is so irritating and i beg the programmers to remove this,0
spotify i just love using it when im in games on my xbox and im not talking to someone i plug my headphones in and listen to my favourite band lovejoy lovejoy are amazing btw i suggest listening to one day by them lovejoy i love your music,1
the app is great the experience so far has been top notch keep it up spotify,1
really love the large collection of songs too much ads please include clear whole history option,0
good music but i cant stream music through data so only downloaded music while on the road  didnt have that the past couple years,0
brilliant,1
this was a very food app until i used it in the first but after sometime i couldnt listen to individual songs that was very vexing because i had to go through the whole playlist,0
the most recent version is stopping audio every time my phone locks and doesnt show a playpause bar in the app or in my notifications the way its supposed to,0
been a member since its inception and have never been displeased with the app,1
great app really easy to navigate however creating playlist and discovering new songs is a nightmare they resently removed the feature to preview the song before adding it to your playlist making it almost impossible to find new songs which i really dumb they should add it back but its alright for listening on car trips and stuff,1
i absolutely love this appyou get all kinds of songs your into and very affordable prices for theyre premium packageskeep up the good work spotify,1
always perfect made my life better through difficult years,1
the ads are supposed to be after half an hour but this app irritates alot with frequent ads i have faced at least 3 times ads within half an hour duration if this stays on i will never recommend this app to anyone and definitely going to uninstall the app talking about the good side the app is overall 4 star,0
i still find the songs i want quick  easy,1
app controls do not automatically load in windows 11011 i occasionally have to uninstall and reinstall to see info and controls other than that its great  premium version,0
spotify cares doesnt care at all when we demand to fix an issue immediately regarding a song that has been hacked,0
nice free podcasts,1
absolutely recomend its an amazing app but one problem is the ads its alaway that same stupid add about northern kentucky unitversity damn that stupid place,0
literally my comfort music app i love it so much its good for chilling and very comforting i love the idea the creators had and overall this is the best one yet i love it and its actually good i like the music but there are ads and i hate it but its alright i like how we get to choose whos our fav artists and this app just comforts me so much i love it and i wish it got more popular,1
on iphone spotify was working fabulously well  just switched to samsung on one ui 4 spotify simply doesnt open only stays on logo tried restarting mobile also reinstalled app but nothing,0
brand new and love this app love how they dont bow down to cancel culture too,1
um ok i understand having ads without premium but come on three ads in a row one ad okay two ads eh it is what it is but three ads why- overall its okay,1
my daily companion i thought i knew music well but spotify has opened my ears and eyes to a much richer world,1
best app in the market literally everyone uses it very user friendly interface even the premium version is worth it,1
i thought i struck gold moving over from yt until the trial i didnt know about ended - i cant even select a song anymore im not averse to paying i was formerly a yt premium member - but looking at your offering for non-paid why the hell would anyone want to use this your ads are even worse here,0
its good app no problem with this app thanku spotify ,1
a library that doesnt have categories so i have to search for everything ads in podcasts from spotify for paying customers despite a no ads promise,0
impressed by the sound quality,1
only app i like enough to pay a monthly payment for i have a large playlist of the music i like and can follow the podcasts i like the car mode could use a little bit of work but it is easily disabled if needed,0
hi this app is really nice i listened to many songs and podcasts but the problem is that only i cant download songs and add in my episodes so that i can listen them in offline mode also please fix this problem,0
normally this app is good but in the past couple of day it has been very glitchy it has been playing random songs and not starting with vehicle as it normally does please fix soon or i will cancel my premium membership,0
cant use my bluetooth headset to watch podcasts as it thinks im in the car,0
spotify won my heart in feb 2024 you won my heart with music and lyrics and then language educational podcasts and audio books you finally won my heart over with just a free trial and i was convinced i found what i have been looking for all these while and finally settling down with this like marriage haha,1
zero support going to support on their app sends you to promotions for premium service if i cant get support no way im paying for your crapp simple issue turning off autoplay does not work i am forced into a random program when the one i sought out ends annoying af esp bc it causes me to lose track on a history list if i dont want fkn autoplay dont fkn force it on me jfc,0
buggy the mobile app crashes and wont display downloaded episodes when you dont have service which is the whole point of downloaded episodes i use the app on my chromebook and it skips all the time if you have any other web pages open,0
love spotify being retired i love to listen to some of my favorite songs of today and years gone by thank you spotify for making this available to me and others as well,1
love this app easy to download  use in an instant,1
glad to be back with spotify miss my music,0
like others i have found the app glitchy recently with a disappearing navigation bar cutting out unexpectedly during playback etc i wont continue paying a subscription for this service much longer,0
to many ads especially it cuts off song to play a ad,0
so much advertisement and its so irritating besides that resso has great features and for podcast use google podcast do what you like not that everyone use spotify so i should do no,0
switched to a new phone recently and havent had any problems as of yet so switched it to a 5 star rating issues with previous phone galaxy s8 were probably partly due to a lack of free storage still sad i couldnt use the app properly there even though i downloaded my most listened to music and pay for premium,0
lit app especially when youre either alone or with friends i just dont like the fact that their are less ads on the when using a computer and when you use a phone their are much more ads,0
after latest updateit will stop playing after a few songs and sidebar always shows nothing is playing,0
i hate it when they add random dumb songs to my playlist and i cant even remove them and the song im finding doesnt even pop up its just random songs that i hate,0
spotify is the best,1
the app is so buggy its ridiculous the tracks dont appear podcasts are hard to find and downloaded songs dont play when i dont have wifi like they used to really disappointing the older versions were far better which is so surprising,0
the spotify algorithms work well but the app has broken ui in dark mode on miui global 1256 android 11 the playpause button has incorrectly set colors as well as some other elements on the play screen,0
paid for spotify premium so youd expect to have no issues however spotify tells me every month that my payment didnt work and to try a new payment method although there is money in the bank for them to take my  2021 wrapped does not work either,0
i hated iheartradio so i am trying this it is an improvement over iheart so far however some things could be streamlined better an auto-download feature would be great especially if it sent all the downloaded podcasts to their own playlist the ability to reorder a playlist or library should be an option overall i have to touch the screen more than i prefer to get to where i want updated 7822 new updates have reduced this app to hot garbage,0
its so good for listening musics and podcasts,1
please stop pushing podcasts on me i use your app for music not stupid shock jock podcasts that you pay millions of dollars to support and has-been ex uk royals i wish you supported musicians to that extent app is ok but the widget only one available is sub par please improve the aesthetics and provide more size configurations the limited clunky widget makes this app less useful for me than i believe it should be for the amount i pay bring back neil young not covid misinformation,0
spotify crashes everytime i play a song i reinstalled it but it still crashes,0
nowadays it is not goodit will ask so many times login and it takes more time to play the music,0
bhai aaj kal spotify bhi apni aukat dikha raha hai,1
the update ruined it now music plays without showing up so you cant hit pause and the only way to get it to show is to restart the whole app,0
good app so far compared to the rest  still getting use to it  it has all your collection,1
1 the space it consumes can sometimes exceed 12gb in phone memory i mean what even is going on here 2 no internet connection bug 3 some songs cant be played but still show up normally just like other songs instead of being greyed out like similar non-playable songs,1
i have been with spotify since they begin i enjoy the music selection i enjoy the idea if i cant afford the membership at least i still got a way of listening to the music,1
just waiting for joe rogan make a decision on which platform to stream on then canceling my spotify sub grow some balls spotify or borrow them from you women random pauses in the music is a real downer,0
another voice for a buggy update wont track played music wont take pauseplay commands from bluetooth you do one thing guys do it correctly please,0
so many oldies but goodies have returned - even obscure ones thanks for the memories,1
ive known this app for quite a long time but was never interested in using it but the moment i attempted making use of the app i never looked back the developers of the app did a great job in creating such a master piece of an app no wonder its the 1 streaming app in the us,1
extremely sluggish app takes a minute to start on a brand new phone also the ceo is a retard regarding music as something that only has one goal profit,0
love this app i have the premium family pack and i gotta say im so happy dont know why i hadnt joined sooner i keep finding songs that i forgot about the nostalgia kicks in whenever i come across an oldie but goodie and im back to where i was all those years ago  i love that you can play the songs offline too now i just download and play wherever i am im listening to one of my play lists right now lmao ,1
new update today made it terrible cant listen to what i want it will only play a preview of a song,0
wonderful awesome spectacular,1
i used to love this app but now that you cant see the songs in the playlist i just dont like it,0
really nice app i thoroughly enjoying it ,1
i love spotify and i love how open joe rogan is as a black man just a man btw i find him and his many guests to be delightful there are guests im not inclined to listen to on his show but listening to differing opinions in my life has helped me along the greatly wherever joe puts up content like his podcast ill definitely be there too also thank you personally spotify for all the wonderful work you do as well i often find the recommendations are awesome cory berisko,1
awesome app i have the premium version which i buy every month there is one thing that bothers me when im playing my playlist on shuffle and i hear a song i like but i hit the button to go to the next song by accident so i click the back button to go to the previous song but it doesnt let me,0
amazing app some few kinks to work out but other than that amazing experience,1
after update app automatically exit when play song,0
please fix the app constantly crashes literally 37 seconds of a song plays and the app closes itself,0
love the variety of music i have my calming piano music to put me to sleep at night which is so much better then the radio as no ads i change my play list off and on my with my moods i love country music and the 70s rock music i found music that bring back such great memories i would recommend this service to all keep up the great job love to be able to pick and choice my own music,1
when i reinstall it the lyrics disappearedi thought it was available for everyone last version with premium edit i try old version and the lyrics are working fine so the problem is with the new version edit again still doesnt work,0
cant watch video cant skip cant use settings suck ,0
there needs to be an easier way to close this app besides a forced stop through my settings on phone iheart is starting to look like a better option in functionality i cant even shut off or restart phone without this app trying to run when i dont want to currently have it open,0
best music streaming app out there as long as you got the 5month premium it is the best app you will have on your phone,1
the app is perfect for listening but but butthe ads are too problematic plus the shuffle button isnt available,0
making your free version crappier isnt going to encourage me to give you money its going to encourage me to delete your worthless app,0
please have variety in your ads i cant listen to the same song chaand baaliyan ko hatao,0
has been crashing lately when trying to play music or podcasts,0
yall is really trynna charge people to skip a song no maam,0
the app was working fine but now i cant seem to download any music and it is on a premium family account every time i try to download a song album or playlist it downloads until a certain point and then it just loads ive tried transferring the data to my sd card numerous times and i have deleted and reinstalled spotify numerous times and the problem still doesnt go away please look into what may be causing this type of problem to occur,0
worst this app only 3 or 4 songs skip advestament,0
too much ads,0
love the platform especially now that the pressure is on and they refuse to cave to the woke mob,1
keeps crashing or doesnt display any of the tabs to pauseplay etc when music is playing,0
good app but kinda pisses me off considering the fact that u can play whatever song u want in desktop in ur liked songs but with mobile it just lets u preview it and u need premium for it,0
more adds,1
app is a memory hog it runs slow on all devices no ability it down rate anything this is balanced by search anything and find app has changed its shape a few times and no option to use a different layout,0
great experience just a bit glitchy at points,0
excellent got all the music i like and so much more recommended,1
this app is buggy too often if you dont update it and even if you updated it its still bugging but not too often so the question is is it worth paying 10-15 per month hell no i pay to have a good quality time listening music not a buggy app that stop my fave music randomly pls fix your app,0
good music app  you can listen offline or online and make playlists with songs you like  you can also find playlists and podcasts i recommend getting this app ,1
keeps starting by itself but when i want to liaten to music the app takes long to start up i have a galaxy s8plus it quick with any other app but this one thinking of changing to another app,0
i love spotify the only reason i am leaving a 1 star is because this app recently burned through 137gb of my data over the last 2 days which i was connected to wifi for most of the time for reference my average spotify data consumption is around 15gb a month with the highest prior to this being 32gb i do not understand how it is even possible for spotify to use that much data in 2 days but now i have no data left until mid march which i need for my job,0
listening to music is a great tool and this is the best app to use i have bought premium membership and its just so great i can listen to everything i want whenever i want,1
nice,1
great app has all of my favorite music choices,1
very good as i have found everything i have looked for,1
so far everything works good ive found the music i want and have had no problems with it,1
i can always find the music im looking forno matter how old or new a true music experience,0
i love the lyrics feature the automatic playlist creation per song feature and my discover weekly playlist xoxo,1
best app for music and recommendations is very fabulous thank you team spotify ,1
i love spotify its easy has every genre of music for one low price,0
wow great app for music,1
very nice app but sometimes its difficult to search an appropriate song of a particular artist most of the time during search it appears for most uncommon artists rather than renowned one i am saying it for bengali songs,0
works well for the most part hangs occasionally with just a few bugs,1
well from my experience its a good app i never encountered any annoying problems or anything so yeah good job,1
very useful all music i wanted choose no problem,1
since november last year my spotify doesnt let me play songs in my playlist for longer than 10 seconds very frustrating,0
mostly good a lot of wifi connection issues seems to have trouble connecting to the internet over wifi at times will have to switch to data to use  connection issues seem to have resolved however the player now playing controls seems to have disappeared from the ui can still play but no longer see the now playing interface on the app nor in my task drawer,0
i have had this app a short while i really like it a lot i cant wait to have all my music where i want i recommend you thankyou di,1
its tooo good app to lising the song,1
great service for music and podcasts app can be buggy though it especially has trouble playing through cars not just mine over bluetooth but once i get it started it usually keeps playing,0
i use spotify a lot and enjoy the range of music available i have been introduced to more artists which great,1
was good now i cannot play anything just keeps pausing every second after i hit play never did this before no interpretations during ads but impossible to listen to now ive cleared cache data and reinstalled nothing helps,0
not sure whats happened but since last few updates the shuffle feature has gotten worse and worse kinda annoying only hearing 10 songs from a playlist on repeat due to the problems with it,0
next update will be probably like if you want to listen hit songs then purchase membership,1
fantastic app bc it so cool an easy to use,1
easy access to music but every time i answer the phone after using the app the music comes on during the phone call since new update the playback bar at the bottom of the screen isnt coming up app is now unusable ,0
i love listening to spotify while cooking cleaning working out or to help the kids sleep but recently the play bar missing with no way to access the play screen to connect to alexa skip or pause a quick uninstallreinstall fixes the issue but is incredibly inconvenient google searches state this has been a known issue for android users and that it has been fixed but clearly not as ive uninstalled and reinstalled several times app is buggy service has a wide variety for the family,0
skip to main content learn how gboard gets better you can help improve voice and typing for everyone when you use the keyboard a technology called federated learning helps gboard learn new words and phrases without sending the text you speak or type to google what gboard learns might be sent to google services without including what you typed or spoke where it will be combined with learnings from other users to create better speech and typing models gboard only learns when your phone isnt,0
this app is okay but you turn off similar songs to be played spotify still plays them 1 star for lack of functionality on their part,0
just fix the connectivity issue i dont know what causes the connection to break in the app but it doesnt have to do anything with the network signal while using mobile data kindly fix the same at the earliest,0
this app is incredible its very very good to use and i am enjoying my music everyday every minute and every seconds i love it,1
love this app   surely recommend it to all age groups  walks of life ,1
amazing quality and choice off artists ,1
this app needs fixed bad it cuts in and out of songs im a premium user it is also not letting me start the song over and when it does it still cuts in and out please fix this soon thank you,0
having issues on all devices apotyify just keeps stopping and starting again it also doesnt have the menu where you can see whats playing that you can open for skipping playing ect,0
good in my opinion i think that you should be able to choose what ever song without paying for premium,1
it is good other then the ads,1
best for update  and waste your net first and second play song i am listening the song but 1 min ma update i am open app crash ,0
good,1
great app lots of songs,1
a few bugs and glitches with the ui but besides that its pretty solid for music,1
it was great when i first downloaded it but now it crashes my phone every time i use the app also no matter the amount or variety of playlists i have it always seems to play the same 50 songs,0
best music platform for sure,1
great selection and integrations point loss for ui though could give users more control and could have more features especially in the podcast space automatic podcast downloads being the first thing that comes to mind,0
great app brilliant music the best,1
this is the best app to listen to for all kinds of music i love this app so much it is the best ever,1
i like this app but recently i found a bug where i cant clear spotifys playback notification in single swipe,0
dharmendra,1
as other have stated the app is ridiculously buggy at the moment constantly stops mid song crahses all the time the track playing bar either doesnt show up or is frozen,0
love to listening music it makes my day to make me more confidence to think in positive and make plan for my future ,1
glitchy and unacceptable my spotify has always been glitchy closes at random skips multiple songs switched out of the playlist to a random one however now its beyond bad the play bar disappears constantly for days on end this means i cant skip pause add songs to playlist pause podcasts ect i think this is absolutely unacceptable for a paid app yes ive force stopped the app deleted and re download it,0
used to be great bring back the separate play and shuffle play buttons its such a pain realising youve hit shuffle having to turn off loads of features just to keep your sanity sucks auto mixing playing similar music once an album or playlist has finished shouldnt be on my default stop changing things for the sake of it this should be about playing music not working out how to turn off a new dumb feature i know companies your size wont act on a persons review or even reply,0
music is not playing when ever i try to play songs app is getting closed automatically,0
excellent catalogue of music in any genre thought of,1
i disabled the automatic and timer player but nothing works on this app  waking me up at 12 am  with this music that i dont even like and i couldnt find a way to delete this music from play recently or from history,0
thank you developers for develop this app,1
for the last few years i have loved spotify but as of late the update has created an issue in playing every song it will just stop at the start of every second or so song and its infuriating,0
more than dew timesoffline mode is glitching every month ,0
great music collections,1
paying for premium and still getting ads otherwise would love the app but this is getting ridiculous and its been doing this long enough theres no way that in several months of this issue that they couldnt find a fix why should i keep giving them money i will be looking for a replacement for this app,0
great music options and i dont mind the adds,1
the app has been crashing a lot lately idk but pls fix it,0
love the sound quality and that i can make my own playlist from it,1
trash app 100 its pay to listen i can play song that i want it will play random song,0
several years using the app its had its ups  downs throughout the years with adding or removing features of which your happiness or disappointment would be relative as an objective review the app does 100 what its supposed to do play music it does it well and there are some great features available for those with a premium subscription including no shuffling playing specific songs or albums downloading those songs for offline listening and of course no ads ymmv,1
i have been using this app since around 2018 and i would say it is pretty good i dont have any complains i dont have premium cause im just not going to pay for it but i dont mind the ads either so yea,1
i like this app,1
terrible from ads in a premium service and poor support for music makers to supporting covid misinformation spotify is a greedy abomination there are much better music streaming services out there this isnt one of them,0
it lets me listen to music,1
the songs sound quality and the ui are all greatbut the ads the ads were the issue because of which i shifted from gaanabut it started here as wellbetter than gaana yeah but still to many adsand just a suggestion u should add an option to update blends instantlyif the ads are reduced this is the greatest songs app,1
its different and better than amazon music that you literally pay twice for i dont get it pay for prime get some music add unlimited and get all music dumb i pay one set price and get the same stuff here on spotify,1
automatic 1 star for not having an ability to edit home tab layout cannot hideremove podcasts,0
my app is installed and now its saying no internet connection whats the matter,0
exceptional loads of music to listen for the young and not so young,1
please remove the annoying as all hell pop up asking to allow bluetooth access even if i briefly minimize the app it will ask again i am real close to canceling spotify because of this annoyance,0
keeps crashing on android before it worked normallly,0
love this app great choices of music and up todate titles,1
love the choices plays well in my car and home just wish i could afford it again times are tough for some of us,1
update did not change anything but the visual text size it seems i cant scroll through my library i have to use the arrow keys no way to select multiple songs in like playlist to delete at a time so have to individually un-heart 400 plus songs i guess ctrl  a doesnt work to select all for my chromebook,0
great app with premium while it was functional but recently its become basically unusable the music stops playing shortly after my phone locks and will come back on when the woken up,0
just fixn to remember how i liked it last time,0
easily comfortable and reliable,1
i downloaded the ue hyperboom app the spotify app doesnt work well with this i cant see what track is playing i cant pause i cant see which track is next something got messed up with ue hyperboom connectability suuuuuucks,0
spotify used to be so good now its like we have to pay for everything like why are my skips limited and i only get a preview of wht is on my liked songs yall gotta fix this mess and bring back the stuff that used to be free,0
just the best way to stream music i use other apps to find music i love listern then open  save it in spotify brilliant,1
another bloatware app that never closes and runs in your backround uninstall,0
this is a terrible app and would not recommend it first it was going great until i tried to play songs from my playlist but it wouldnt let me all it would play was billie joel i hate billie joel i would give you a zero start rating but i cant dont download,0
super ,1
yall trippin like nobody cares if u have a problem with spotify just listen to ur music and stfu,0
money by lisa is missing someones song replaced it look into this immediately,0
spotify has been getting more and more unstable in each update now it often wont show me what song im playing at the bottom of the screen making impossible to pause skip forward or backward 15 seconds or interact with it in any way also the songs will stop playing randomly for no reason at all not an internet problem it also happens with downloaded songs the former problem usually happens after the app has been in background for a while not playing anything,0
nice,1
absolutely love spotify a must for all music lovers especially if youre genres vary all the time do yourself a favor and get premium make your own playlists and look up any random song you here,1
its very good for me to listen with a lots of vibe songs,1
it doesnt work very well at times i dont like that,0
allow us to have unlimited swipes even tho not with premium and move the time of our song,1
you know why,1
sorry man bad app it dosnt let me play my whole playlist and it just anoys me please spotify change this ill give it a solid 5 stars if you did i am disapointed about this thank u,1
great for spotify,1
i dont know if im doing anything wrong but i cant seem to listen to the songs i want to listen to doesnt matter if ive made a playlist or not when i click the play button it plays every song except for the one i want,0
all of a sudden i keep losing the ability to manage the podcasts ie pause or rewind and have to keep logging out and sometimes reinstalling the app to get this working again,0
i dont like the new update old update i was able to find my songs now i cant find any of my songs,0
been running into a bunch of bugs recently the most annoying is that i cant add more than one thing to the queue if i keep adding it will just erase the previous addition and i have to restart my phone several times to get it to work every now and then the control bar will disappear so i cant pause whatever im listening to even if i try from my headphones not to mention the random freezing and shutting down that has been more frequent lately ive reported it before never heard back,0
refund your customers unistalled and reinstalled 20 times deleted cashe and data still cant pause ffwd rewind songs its a known issue for months yet spotify have done nothing liked songs vanish after awhile why the daily drive feature just repeats the same songs because i listen to rain sounds at night even thou i havent liked them the discover playlist is 90 rain sounds when i shazam a song then follow the spotify link it often comes through as song not found,0
absolutely love spotify has gotten better and better,1
very poor wear os integration no auto offline sync of podcasts and cannot go to next track in podcast playlist,0
everybody loves spotify right u can listen to so many song for free,1
fantastic service i can find a lot of great tunes on spotify the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you are forced to listen to album tracks in a random order unlike what the artist intends otherwise keep the good stuff coming,0
best with ads,1
i can never sign in it always says something went wrong its annoying when it does work it is good,0
great playlists to make you dance,1
unusable on samsung phone works perfectly fine on any other devices i have on my samsung flip 3 the app doesnt even allow you to select a song and play it from your liked playlist or an artists page for whatever reason it seems like you are required to have spotify premium in order to play the songs you actually want to play yet this has never been the case for me on anything else i use,0
its a good app i like it but its so damn annoying bec of the ads like i just accidentally clicked some song then literally 3 ads appear  its unskippable im on mobile on pc this app works great so please just let the ads come after a while they keep on popping up,0
the spotify party invites rarely work connects 120 times and there doesnt seem to be a reliable way to connect i press the invite link and it turns on spotify but doesnt join the party,0
seems to be one of the better music apps,1
edit 2022 those stars keep bouncing i guesssince 122121 even though a long-time premium member the app refuses to update many of my favorite showsnow going on another month of paying for a pretty frustrating experience yall are gonna drive me back to another service if you cant sort this stuff,0
super,1
laggy not as good as it was previous versions im not a fan of the new changes plus it wont let access songs when im offline when half the time im just on cellular edit still having the same problems since may 2022why have none of the updates fixed these basic problems ive mostly switched to a different podcast player but still looking for a good alternative music player,0
cant just play my liked songs have to listen to suggested songs which spotify sucks at suggestions not a fan too many ads too much garbage music app doesnt respond to what i want  would rate zero stars,0
the latest updates have been very buggy playback suddenly stops notification doesnt show sometimes even though music is playing there are random unnecessary bluetooth permission requests and eq settings stop when changing songs sometimes hard to get into a good work flow these days,0
spotify connect seems to be very glichy volume control via other devices cant be turned off no matter the options you toggle volume jumps all over the place when using other devices randomly,0
let me re-arrange my liked songs playlist or add an are you sure message before hidingunliking a song,0
its ok but i wish there was an option for them to recommend music in you playlist i wish you could turn it on or off,1
the latest update fixed my inability to even use the app at all but now i cant load and manage my liked songs spotify please fix idk if its device specific but its an lg stylo 6 ps i cant uninstall the app it triggers a shutdown without uninstalling at all thought reinstalling might work but i cant even do that,0
i love me some blues  really like the experience here ,1
useless application with full ads after every song and very long so useless app,0
best streaming service money can buy,0
if i could give this a 0 i would i have used spotify for years and now i am downloading the app and it does not work i have sat here for 20-10 mins just for it to not thanks a lot spotify apple music is 100 times better,0
you cant go against islam,1
why does the app likes to crash every time i listen to music its very annoying,0
easy to navigate and works with boom is why i have it,1
cant live without it very user friendly,0
this app is so ridiculously stupid as hell it has every song you can imagine but why the hell does it play random songs i didnt even put in my playlist its so stupid and plus theres limited skips and you can only shuffle on moblie what the hell its so garbage and stupid it annoys me how this is the only music app other soundcloud which is horrible i really hate this garbage app that is so half assed,0
nice collection and new system,1
brilliant music app better then amazon music well worth the money,1
every move i make it it says to skip you need spotify premium even yt music doesnt do that,0
really disappointed the enhance feature was removed from the liked songs section why do that as a premium subscriber i demand that be reinstated,0
please read carefully i need  thats mean not only me  some time we want to listen only lyrics not music in that song so please give option to skip music by 10 seconds or 5sec max so its help us to take more song in minimum time thanking you,0
so far so good just miss local south african music,1
i want to love this app but music discovery isnt close to being as good as on pandora and my 2019 volkswagen jetta keeps experiencing bugs with this app almost daily it also has difficulty pairing with the car,0
this very nice app for music and podcast and their are many artists you make own playlist ,1
premium subscription all plan cost to high compared to ganna so thats reason im not use spotify ,0
thank you spotify though your platform may be buggy at times i appreciate you being a beacon of sanity in these cancel culture times,1
fhis is very good app for listen music of favourtie singer but there is some problm in this app first very add are there and very long ad but like this app what can we do at home when we havent anything to do  we can pass our time from this app,1
love this app can find most of what i want on here,1
i love this praise channel praise at my fingertips,1
nice what a app this app os the collection of music  it is just like a music world where you can find all the songs,1
everything is okay but for the one who didnt subscribe they r getting ads after every 2 songs before it was after 30mins then ad,0
price is a little more than i care to pay but good service no complaints,1
it is a good listening app with my favorit song and i love it i like two us it on rod trips and in the shawr and at school so i recomend it,1
seamless straightforward simple and fun best,1
i like spotify and all but i kinda wish they added back the feature to preview songs before adding them to playlist it made making playlist easier for me ecpecially song i forget what certain songs sound like,0
it need more options to combine playlist and its lacking a lot of features,0
good app,1
more good,1
i really like the app but i hate the current one i hate that it automatically shuffles your playlist and when you wanna listen to a single song it plays other songs than the song you wanna hear spotify on desktop is better but i cant listen to the desktop spotify because my pc is broken can you please remove it so we can choose between normal repeat and shuffle,0
app keeps crashing and i have the premium version,0
playlists add to home screen feature dont work at all i cant download a single song individually ive to download an entire playlist consumes a lot of internet its removing my favourite songs day by day,0
seems as though when you type in an artist they only play that artist main stream music thats fine an all but id also like to hear some of their music that never made the radiobillboards also when i type in that artist id also like to hear other artist like them and artist from that era i dont care to hear that one artist the entire time until i change the station,1
its easy to organize and find what i love,1
why is it when i play shuffle on liked songs it then plays a random song ive never heard of,0
the best app ever in music the sound quality of music is just amazing literally dont have words to explain ply try this once a moment only have one problem thats the amount of subscription for premium is high so please by the way left all the things are best,1
since the latest update spotify no longer connects to my car stereo had no problems up until then phone is connected but tells me there is no device through spotify,0
this app is seriously so buggy i used to love spotify but it skips like cd well turn off when the screen goes dark the only reason any of us pay for you tube is to avoid this also ive had the play bar disappear on me and i couldnt pause and play the song i had to exit the app to turn off audio im getting so sick of it and ive told my husband its not worth an endless library of songs and podcasts if i cant enjoy listening to them ive uninstalled and reinstalled the app nothing,0
have days it will only play a few seconds of a song then randomly play a defreint song,0
free version not worth it but premium is way worth it if you dont plan on paying for premium dont get it but if you do plan on getting premium their is no better music service,1
awesome ,1
service itself is good but the app definitely needs an update after one song you have to open the app to change songs and doesnt even say a song is playing on s10 problem for some months now its just plain annoying now its gotten much worse,0
fantastic besides not paying artists enough i love having access to soc much music pity not everything is on here though do love this app,1
dont like how you removed listening to songs when adding them to playlists in the latest update,0
it always complain no internet connection whereas my net is already working for other apps it was so frustratingplease check with your networking code backside what outdated protocol they must be using,0
i love this app,1
nice,1
hate the fact that i have to get the premium plan just to pick my own music,0
kool need find out how to speed up music for faster speed for work out,0
ive been using spotify for years its a huge part of everything i do from traveling to the gym,1
every possible obscure tune i like is here super easy to use cant live without my spotify,0
its really nice as you can make your own playlists but it doesnt show songs by its self you need to search them and then add them all one by one,0
i really love this app and it would to amajin if u guys add karaoke in this app ,1
consistently glitches pauses and doesnt work,0
love this app especially the dj station ,1
i love theres so many more options and ways to look for music i love the way its set up and the layout is very organized spotify is awesome i do pay for the premium cuz i cannot stand commercials and when the music stops,1
i love this app but if feels like it will never improve sometimes it just glitches and refuses to play and you have to exist and enter again if you try to listen at the same time with friends theres a delay between when you hear the song and they do even to this day they havent brought listening activity to mobile like just have it as a tab that you can open if you want to there are so many things they could add but they just dont such a shame,0
stop putting random music thats not in my playlist even if my playlist is way over 15 music you keep putting random music that i dont like so really bad app pls fix it,0
this app is just dumb because when ur a starter u can do anything but in few days the spotify got wrong i thought it needs update and update it but goes nothing but i know now that it was need to get premium but we do not have money i thought it was fun to play music but not at now  we cant even download it so i rate it 1 plss do it free,0
i love this app so much because it has all of my favorite songs and the lyrics are the best even if you arent using the lyrics the lyrics goes with the song,1
there are no lyrics in my app tt i have a premium subscription tho i dont think this issue will ever be fixed and so i wont change my rating until then,0
my go to constany updating which will eat your data like nothing else but its worth it,1
its good but when i play a song it makes me go to another random song please fix this,0
i searched for a song appeared when playing it not the song ive searched ,0
its good for female and male who like music the app is good so you can get the app now,1
we couldnt even download any music for free,0
big bug play bar will disapear while playing then user cant stop play the song make the price a big joke,0
as of around the beginning of the month feb 2022 my kenwood car headunits special spotify control mode no longer works i have to use standard bluetooth mode without the direct control features my head unit is marketed with used to work fantastic so i didnt have to touch my phone now just sits on connecting and doesnt do anything tried uninstalling and reinstalling app tried unpairing and re-pairing phone nothing annoying see other reviews say the same thing regarding kenwoods,0
nice and easy to use,1
the most recent update has given me the same issues as everyone else random stops no queue no controls reached out to support they told me to reinstall not very helpful everything was fine prior to this update,0
sitijamilah,1
i used to listen to spotify all the time but now it keeps shutting off in the middle of a song,0
reducing to 3 stars as downloading songs doesnt seem to make a difference either slow to load or simply dont load when my connection is low or disconnected edit reduced straight to 1 star since latest update i cannot play songs on spotify u less i have the app open which is pretty useless tbh it wasnt fixed after 2 weeks so i cancelled my subscription and now it seems that i cant listen to any music just ads ads and more ads deleted ill just use youtube premium instead thanks,0
does not play the full playlist and always ask to pair to bluetooth,0
no longer shows widget on lock screen,0
this app has worked great but recently it has either stopped working casting the audio to external devices such as cambridge audio and google speakers and devices if this is not fixed i will cancel subscription and rather switch to tidal or something similar,0
very nice  app,1
i love spotify i have discovered so much new music i would otherwise never heard the only negative i could say is that you cant always find the exact song you are looking for,0
you cant even listen to an album without suggested songs unless you have premium the whole point gone if you cant listen to an album then just why,0
brother this app is very good but after every three songs the ad comes it is a little annoying otherwise it is a very good app,1
update from truckertwotimes  this app is still getting better depending on how well this app is written ill be back to tell ya guys after i see if this thing handles my entertainment in the car without me having to look at it while im driving ,0
tooooooooo many ads,0
worst lost of ad play one by one after one song ,0
i have been pleased with spotify the variety of music and podcasts,1
i love this app gives me all my favorite artists from grandson to stapleton,1
disappointed hate some of the ads are inappropriate for my taste it eats up a lot of data  memory i was paying ten  a month  then you dont get to keep any of the songs i concur with the same gripes about playlists overall this is no better than any other podcast player going to iheartradio,0
the go to for music best quality pricing and features buying music is the best but short of that spotify is top notch,1
i dont know what changed with updates but my spotify is opening too slowly that loading bar appears and force me to turn off my internet and re open it it is only happening when starting the app it is definitely some kind of bug because i have used this app for 2 years at least there was never a problem like that edit i took back one star,0
best music app i ever used and i had about used everyone of those apps dam near plus its a reasonable price considering all the functions and options it has especially if you are a premium subscriber,1
it recomment good songs and the quatity of audio is best and when adding songs in list the app observes our type os sobgs and recommed which will make us its the best music app ive ever saw,1
imagine an app is 2022 that is trying to make money by irritating its users by disabling some app features on top of force feeding you ads every couple minutes nope thank you i can just play my youtube playlist with the same amount of ads,0
app on android had been getting slower and slower takes ages to do anything no other apps have this issue currently horrible user experience no issue on other oses,0
i love this appcant wait to go premium,1
help why if i am making a playlist i cant listen songs before i put them in my playlist,0
ui needs work by that i mean just a simple feature to be added as to swipe down on the mini player and that ends the song so far so good tho,1
there is one problemwhen a update comes thr app removes our liked songs because of that feature i lost 147 songs and dont remember them all i recovered 45 of em this need to be fixed or tell a solution until then i am giving it a 1 star,0
ffs why does it keep auto-stopping when i have my phone connected to a bluetooth speaker so annoying even more annoying is the android bug that skips to a random track when you click the lock button on your phone happens literally everytime please add support for android,0
way too many ads,0
music is awesome have yet not to find something,1
the mini player bar disappears constantly the only way to bring it back is to cloneopen the app bluetooth controls wont work with the latest update,0
love spotifv so easy to understand and the song selection is endless definitely the best music app out there0,1
i wanted to give a suggestion if there could be language translation of the songs while listening to different language songs in english it would be amazing,1
remove behind the lyrics its pointless since you dont show anything besides the chorus and spends the rest of the time telling you things you really didnt gife af about and accessing the lyrics requires you to swipe up which interferes with swiping to the side to change a song which is far more important no one cares that kurt cobain had a ceasar sald before he released heart shaped box its irrelevant to what your users want to listen to the damn music,0
easy to use great variety of musiv,1
spotify used to be known for recommending good music but lately all it does is recommend the same thirty songs over and over the console version is riddled with bugs come on guys,0
why did u get rid of the sort playlist button it was my best friend ,0
hate the latest update can no longer shuffle personal playlistsort it out or i will end my subscription,0
love it unbelievable if you havent got get it,1
app has been so buggy lately will randomly just stop playing music also ive been having to force close alot lately,0
much better than pandora or apple and youtube music hardly any ads also you can choose your song of choice,1
love this,1
brilliant range of music a must for all,1
i really loved spotify been on premium for long time i could download songs podcasts etc so i could listen offline however recently all these are gone what happened why i have to be online to listen to my downloaded music when im on long haul flight i cant listen to my favourite songs anymore very disappointing -,0
good ui and experience  still need some small improvements in ui ,1
very nice collection of albums picking song selections also on moods,1
i have enjoyed using spotifyit is fun creating liked play lists,1
this app is really nice  but the ads are too much  but it is okay  because for no ads  we have to pay it easy and normal  it is easy to use  thanks for accompany us with my homework ,1
coming from deezer its been a disappointing experience i like the enhance feature but i miss swiping down the playing panel,0
every time i have used spotify since november of 2021 is will pause my music every time my phone loads now since april 10th it has been pausing randomly ive tried everything online but it just isnt working tell me what is wrong please,0
i love spotify i can stream all of foreign language classes,1
i used to love it because i could play my favorite tracks anytime the ads were annoying yet bearable however recently i havent been able to even open the app whenever i try to open spotify it just kicks me out currently im using an alternative i might leave a better review next time if this is fixed,0
would give 5 stars but it is hard to listen to my playlist if not connected to the internet 95 of the time its great,0
updated app 05182022 and the player and controls are completely gone this new version is unusable and extremely buggy as it is an unfinished version released for android devices 15 stars  i need to revert back to an older version now,0
the best app for listening music,1
music stoped playing on google home and when casting to android tv timer is working though but no sound,0
fixed the constant crashing but thumbnails what appear when shared to telegram now,0
just started using spotify love my playlist for driving and exercising lots of great tunes,1
very annoyed  i cant pay for spotify premium it rejects every card and every payment option,0
whywhy does this app suck soooo badly i dont understand is it just me it just stresses me out even more ughhh i dont want to listen to that stupid freaking song i want to listen to my songs is there any explanation to why spotify is acting up like a crack head how does this even have good reviews  why spotify w h y i dont understand,0
i really love it bcz i love songs to and listening a story horror story funny story sad story romantic story that u can listen in spotify you can listen any songs and story and u will enjoy it i promise,1
i love the interface of spotify and how easy it is to use and it being so convenient,1
songs keep pausing missing play menu the app is really bad what the heck happened,0
most of the time spotify will not download media on the first secondsixth attempt music that appears to be downloaded is not i am not sure what the problem is it asks for an internet connection even though both dat and wifi are available frustrating,0
this app is the worst like come on it doesnt let me play music that i want to listen to it just does the album like come on audiomack is way better then this now on xbox its fire look plz fix the problem i know yall can be better now prove me wrong spotify and i believe you can,0
i like but i cant access  some playlist,0
3 minute ads you cant skip,1
love it easy and keeping up with music bomb,1
please add annual subscription the monthly subscription is really annoying if you dont add annual subscription ill shift to spotify mod version,0
i love the music i dont have to play it for anyone but me the music sound great not knack like it would sound on a record player and bad speakers plus there are no ads to mess up your listening pleasure from what i have listened so far its all good,1
shinedown released their new album yesterday and where is it spotify kind of upsetting if im paying for a service that cant provide new releases when actually released also recently when i open my phone without spotify open itll blare music and i cant do anything but restart my phone to stop it also cant see any playpause options on home screen or lock screen anymore unfortunately pretty disappointed lately,0
its been a week that spotify only opens if i connect it to wifi app has so many bugs also there is no point paying for premium if i have to download songs again and again everyday i will highly suggest to not pay for premium services it only eliminates the add and you have to keep downloading songs every freaking day to get them offline,0
been having this app since 2017 best music app ,1
good ya,1
app can be laggy sometimes the search feature is not smart enough to predict what youre looking for most times you have to type in exactly what youre looking for,0
being able to listen to such high bitrates and only paying 129 php for music this convenient is a steal keep it up spotify,0
love the music but the massive volume imbalance between the music and the overloud adverts is serious annoying and needs sorting asap,0
some things dont make much sense to me like songs from playlists  how u cant really listen to an individual song but instead u have to listen to songs like this,0
recent changes make the app useless i dont have a navigation bar half the time and constantly need to force close it,0
a very wide selection of music is available and the app is not complicated to use,1
best app to listen music but there are adds,1
its really good and i bet their going to fix the bugs that are their but 5 stars,1
what happened to the player it doesnt display anymore the phone plays music like its possessed,0
this app is horrible i tried to make an account with my when i was born but its not working i think they need to work on this cuz im just doing what i have to do i wanted to test it out and listen to some music not on youtube and its horrible utterly horrible i dont understand how people will like this but i will not recommend this,0
absolutely love it best thing to happen to music to be able to access anything you want they customize ur playlist and listening experience a,1
why do you keep on logging me out all my downloaded playlist is gone everytime there is a new update i get logged out,0
how many ads very irritating ads and long ads,0
for a music app it sure doesnt hesitate to play video ads extremely annoying especially since i have limited data,0
i like this app but when i start listening to music from liked songs theres a song witch i didnt even liked and its annoying because its usually in romanian and i hate the romanian music,0
the new update is not good at all you cant change your song whenever you want you have to shuffle whichi think you should have the option to change it whenever you want,0
sheesh cool music and i love it,1
why does the song details keep disappearing cant even change loop settings or stop songs,0
app wont work for me at all i cant play any music and i have premium it also says all playlists are empty the app used to work perfectly for me now i cant get it to work on this device at all,0
ive been paying for premium for awhile i over 1000 song and it will only shuffle through 20 of them at best the app is getting stupid glitchy ive uninstalled and made sure its up to the latest update dudes whats going on ive love this app but its starting to wear my patience,0
my opinion is to play a ad every 1 hr rather than playing ad for every half an hour,0
never had a problem with spotify love listening to podcasts on it,1
spotify can go eff itself wont let me sign back in wont let me play music off line even though i paid to have this feature now just paid up for the family subscription and it wont let me sign in not bloody happy ive uninstalled the app now reinstated it and its still giving me grief ,0
spotify definitely has a slight learning curve but definitely my favorite music app they have nearly every song i look for once you learn the app its so easy to navigate they just added a feature where i can filter my liked songs by genre which is awesome but it glitches and i am not always able to see all my options ,0
worked well in previous versions latest versions frequently cause issues where the controls are not displayed hoping this bug will be resolved soon i use spotify all the time,0
i am okay with ads but the problem is that we have limited amount of skips and we cn choose the song we want to hear,0
loveyou,1
unable to close spotify on android 11 phone i even logged off spotify and it still shows on my notifications bar,0
great love the fact that you can search up famous musicians from the 70s you can even like how many songs you would hear over and over again my sister has over 400 songs in her like list she is still trying to pick more songs to like and more songs to here great app and i love it so much one more thing is that if you dont pay premium you can still shut off your phone great job spotify ,1
no internet connection i have paid membership of spotify but since i am using this app facing same issue again and again that is when i have internet connection on or connected with wifi and connection is live and running on full speedspotify app shows no internet connection i even contacted with spotify team and i told about problem they assured me to solve the problem but issue remains unresolved,0
app no longer works properly will cancel and try a different service,0
app is garbage now randomly removes songs from playlists and removes downloaded songs entirely,0
nice just dont like how many adverts there are if you dont like adverts dont get this but there are podcasts and other intredting stuff like music it has lyrics that help if you want to do some singing aha so yeah its so good,1
i wouldnt normally use an app that plays constant advertisements interrupted by the occasional song but i have this app installed so that i can watch joe rogans show without this show the app would be totally redundant and would never see the light of day on my phone,0
in 2022 spotify still does not offer the option to select multiple albumssongs i had to select everything for manual download again after reinstalling spotify due to the massive amount of errors i had,0
thanks for free books and music,1
enjoy using this app to listen to pod casts and music,1
it hard to use on mobile and only mobile but on other platforms it easy to use,0
05 taking 173gb storage pauses not buffer after every song until i open the app and hit play bug the playpause button works fine on the lockscreen but not the skip button the backwards button doesnt work because you cant go back even one song or even to the beginning of the song you are on unless you pay upon closing the app it will close the window but stay open in the background swipe down from top to see you can only access shuffle mode not able to choose the order of music unless you pay,0
i am just really enjoying the variety thank you,1
i liked that your leadership did not cencor joe rogans episodes with dr malone and mcculloch when all other major platforms would so i gave the app 5 stars but now that you caved allthough only slightly to media pressure i had to go in and change it definitely a step in the wrong direction for peoples freedom to think for themselves,0
spotify has been having so many issues lately music seems to stop playing randomly cant skip nor pause something needs to be done im paying for the service,0
amazing but missing one of my favourite bandsalbums  so 4stars until the band atheist and their album elements shows up,0
worst app ever i useplay ads more than songs,0
the experience was great but the prices change from an area to another and its cheaper in other places,0
an awsm song streaming app the best of all like the bestttt ,1
good to use,1
my liked songs playlist was around 11k when i started to have troubles with this app spotify seems to be unable to handle a playlist this big and i cant really see why if i search for a song or just add it to queue it works fine but i cant play it straight out of my playlist anymore this happens on all devices i tested macbook ipad pro oneplus nord windows pc and is really annoying i am willing to wait a bit till all the songs are loaded but at least play them at some point,0
kinda wish we had more than just 6 skips even 10 skips would be fire im only saying this now because im trying to find out what type of songs i like also the bugs are something i aint fond of im sorry but im only giving this 3 stars other then all the reason i disliked the app its nice,0
fix this stupid app man i just wanna listen to music of my choice but im getting forced to listen to random songs added by this app on my playlist  no one wants to pay just to skip songs so make ot for free when i remove i song from my playlist it still plays and this app bugs too much again fix this god forsaken app,0
stop recommending toxic content that has no connection to my usage allow users whove been using the service for years now for music to block podcasts as whole stop peddling your agenda,0
zero stability and reliability will not show the now playing music has been stopping randomly and has issues resuming when you accidentally swipe to the next podcast in queue you lose the podcast you were listening to,0
low price a month for music podcasts etcnever thaught mutch of it until i got spotify no ads and thats the best part no interruptions while listening to music or podcastsalot of albums and artists only problem is its hard to find bass bossted or mixed songs because its not made by the artist ,0
far too many ads ruins your listening experience,0
its best music app in india,1
they just started to put adds promoting premium duo regardless you paying premium im might stop paying for premium account,0
if it wasnt a free app i wouldnt pay for it song selection sucks too many ads,0
you guys are absolutely useless logged me out of my account im damn paying for to now i cant even use i cant log in with the email i used a few years ago im now fuming,0
a huge range of all different types of music for all ages,1
amazing app but i have spotify premium its a great service but when i started making playlists off of premium i would get a preview of the song i put it and now i cant on premium please put in that features,0
some genius thought the interface needed a revamp and changes the layout of all the play button so frustrating,0
thank you spotify you are definitely better than the rest,1
love it havent had any problem pulling up any songsalbums or concerts that i asked for really awesome app,1
given how much the subscription is the app is surprisingly littered with bugs and tidbits that make the interaction with and functionality of the app irritating in the most recent round of updates the spotify app displays a pop-up banner telling me to enable bluetooth ive hit allow numerous times yet im still hit with the same banner other times the app is unable to resume playback of songs making it requisite to force stop the app,0
really great music app but i dont like how some times it plays random songs or dosent play in order cant tell if thats just me,0
i love your program the music i find there is fantastic,1
the update sucks since it happened there are too many restraints on what people without premium can play its dumb i hate it remove this or people will leave spotify,0
super app add new songs please ,1
best music app out there,1
no longer connects to kenwood spotify app in my car bluetooth comnects and plays fine but the spotify app is totally broken now,0
i think its better if there are lyrics and if you dont use hangul for korean its easy just latin,0
look great app cool and stuff but why cant i play the song i click it plays songs before playing the one i picked,0
the app is amazing the selection is broad and their recommendations are on point i dont use premium but ads arent too problematic the only problem is that the app absorbs storage im not sure why because i use wifi and clear the cache but the app still takes up over a gb of storage its a minimal annoyance but inconvenient nevertheless overall i would reccomend it,0
they did some updates and now i cant skip or pause songs,0
buggy to the point that im considering switching services restarting the app is now a ritual of being a user wasnt always like this only the past few months whatever the case dev team has shown little signs of a fix coming any time soon,0
spotify is censuring open conversation podcasts because a small group of bad actors unistalling because spotify has no spine,0
its good but i have my data on and says im offline when i alr fixed the mms port on my side in the settings so pls do something,0
i love this app,1
music is the best and when there is a platform that makes it so easy to listen to it its great,1
best app i have ever seen and discovered  every type of songs are available in this app no ads and no more bugsglitches my experience was great with this app but i cant download the songs i wanna download my favorite songs in my folders but it is not downloading it and i dont even know how to download songs you just have to download your musicsongs with over all i loved it really unique and amazing app  see aa,1
it works great and allows you to watch all content unlike youtube,1
great quality the only thing is it puts random songs on and only 6 skips per hour,0
good app but i have request to improve the app like picking group of songs that you want to play in the time that you might be going to sleep or for sharing a song out loud and maybe you can pick what songs you get to listen to,0
this app must stop publishing false news about coronavirus before i would reinstall highly disheartening and quite frankly horrifying that this is happening on such a popular venue money is clearly more important than the common good for you you should be ashamed,0
the good things about spotify were probably already said by other users so let me review the negative side sometimes i feel uncomfortable while using this app because when i listen to music it suddenly stop and i had to go back open the app and check why is it stop and i need to click the pauseplay button so i could continue listening the music after i updated the app it lagging a lot and sometimes the lyrics wont show up please fix the bugs  keep up the performance of the app,0
i love the variety of content and perspectives,1
out standing bass and sound quality i like it ,1
spotify does not work in afganistan  please make it easy for  so sad for not working here ,0
this app makes my day better after a long one listening to the music is just so easy and accesable toatally recomend,0
if there was a 0 star  i would have give that  this app is horrible  trash garbage and everything  you can skip only 6 songs per hour  these limits are fricin suck,0
love it listen almost every morning great to wake up to,1
i am slowly going mad with this app these suggested songs dont fit my playlists at all i am about to lose my ing mind with this st fix this now or i will delete this for good,0
this is the best app for music,1
this app is awesome you can find a lot of songs here before have using another app to hear music but i cant find lot of songs there but here i could find a lot of music what i have searching for but one or two songs are not here like so many things i do and girl please add those songs,1
too much advertisementthey say 30 mins continuous listening and the ad arrives only after 10-12 mins,0
the best app ever to listen to music ,1
am very happy with spotify  i can enjoy my lovely music every day ,1
yeah its very nice with premium but also with free good and the very all good thing is it consume very less data since you can play whole day than also ,1
i love to hear ads its so satisfying but sometimes musics play and interrupt the ads i request to fixed this problem so i enjoy ads peacefully great app,1
app has become unusable after months of crashing i tried uninstallingreinstalling and now it wont open at all extremely frustrating to pay for a service that i can no longer reliably use on my phone,0
edit sound quality still sucks,0
wonderful easy and clear music not hectic,1
you can listen to almost every song u want and there can be some adds but besides that its really good you can make play lists and you can also get premium but it costs money you can also just get a family one you can get one just for your self to so definitely recommend it to you so if you have free time to install the app please do and try it or,1
worked fine until now now unable to stream to google home ,0
i listen music anytime this is the perfect app for people like me buy yourself spotify premium its not a waste there arent some song but its the best music app ever,1
it has every kind of music almost all genres  you can easily find k-pop songs,1
i cant listen to my songs like its so dumb the old one was better,0
i mean wow if youre still using literally any other music streaming platform you might as well revert back to lanterns outhouses and a horse and buggy because this is the best piece of technology to ever happen to music paying the 1299  month for duo premium that includes two accounts is as much a monthly necessity as our electric bill at this point,1
beautiful app helps concentrate even when i dont want to like now and will hear some soft meditative songs of own choice and will accelerate my day with refreshness and productivity - damodar boruah author assam,1
its very weird i installed it and it was good now i go to my liked songs literally plays 30 secs of the song and a ton of ads doesnt even play the chourus playlist is so bad i have so many songs and i have not listened to it i dont know what happend it was good but now its really bad,0
i enjoy listening to podcasts but the app has problems it keeps locking up and closing on my galaxy 22 and listening to downloaded content primarily having to switch between listening online and offline i live in the sticks and do not have good cell service or wifi at home  listen to podcasts there is absolutely no possible reason i should have to switch between modes to listen to content i have downloaded to device i paid for service so i would be able to download  listen,0
everytime it comes to an ad in my podcast it changes episodes and deletes the episode i was originally listening to so i have to figure out where i left off and download it again,0
smooth and easy find the music you like,1
earlier there was an issue as my spotify kept pausing and buffering but i contacted the spotify community and they turned out to be really helpful ver cooperative particularly my advisor satarla k thanks to the team and definitely a great app,1
great variety of content interesting and educational podcasts lots of my favourite artists all in one place i love my playlists and the ease of creating new ones thank you,1
i deleted spotify and downloaded it again approx 2 weeks back and i havent been log in to my account ever since then 1 no there is no server or network issue at my end 2 i was able to log in on the web version of spotify in opera browser in my laptop which means the issue is in the app 3 i have tried changing my password using otp and even direct link that i got in my email but all were unsuccessful and everytime it throwed an error please look into it and reply,0
28may2022 this app is good i have try many music app but from my view i found it very good but the problem that annoy me and all that in free version you add ad after one or two song before i get 30 min ad free version but now it didnt give and the ad distrub me alot my mom dont allow for premium also fix this because ad after every song is soo much annoying by the user,0
its the best music app when you have premium i personaly like it,1
turn off the covid warning rubbish the world has moved on clogging up my podcast feeds close to unsubscribing,0
enjoyable  its only when you listen to radio stations daily that you realise how repetitive they are,0
why take out listening to the song clips when adding songs to your playlist thats just kinda dumb,0
love the app lowkey the premium version makes it so much better,1
i listen music while gaming tooits fun listening music in spotify,1
app crashing not opening and freezing a lot recently on my galaxy s10,0
too good this music app is by far easy to navigate has a huge selection of what ever genre youre in the mood for and just all around cool,1
hires audio online app enjoy every music clear crisp,1
amazing with premium i highly advice to use with premium because the price is affordable but they should introduce gifts where like they give out free premiums for a short amount of time,1
change name to addifyonly adds for free users nothing else  put 2 min song between 1 hr of adds good strategy to get new premium users by irritating them,0
you are free to pay misinformation spreading people all the money you want just not gonna do it with my money subscription cancelled app removed,0
great app new to me and i find it easy to get songs,1
but like a long time for free instead of just 14 days my daughter said its 3 months,0
me when not spotify  me when spotify ascends,0
i love this app and trust me the premium is definitely worth it,1
podcasts arent available in my area so annoying,0
spotify has so many different music types and songs and its an amazing app,1
hi i just start using it and till now it is great thanks,1
ok so i love spotify so much its my most used app on my phone its something like 240 hours  but i realy hate how it adds songs for you like if i wanted those songs in my playlist i would out them in it like its just a useless and annoying feature,0
keeps constantly pausing itself all the time amongst other things  used be an amazing last few month its gone very glitchy,0
amazing app it helps me find unlimited songs i can find just about every single song i want to the creatorslove the job you guys did making this appkeep up the good workk,1
i absolutely love my spotify app,1
it started off fine but increasingly there have been more and more adds and the enjoy your next 30 minutes of uninterrupted music message is annoying and not true i got a row of adds straight after that message multiple times the negative outweigh the positive but it is nice to create your own playlist and there is a lot of choice for music which i like,1
i having issues with the app on my phone and tv the app on the phone sometime freezes and doesnt work well with my carandroid the app on my tv stalls while playing videos almost every time,0
so far is working as good as perfect,1
play bat keeps disappearing cant pauseplay or change the song sometimes it wont even play a song after selecting it multiple times constantly freezing cant even pause with my headphones when that happens i have to completely close the app and restart it for it to start working,0
the app was so easy to use and the selection of songs fit my taste in music i recommend it to anyone looking for the songs of your choice,1
used to be great but have since added multiple annoying features such as we added and removing the loop buttons these changes are clearly meant to coax the listener into paying for premium ,0
great appbut it would be nice if the home screen could be less cluttered with recomendations i will go search for a playlist if i need new music there is just too much going on,0
verygood catering for individual tastes n likestreats us listeners like we are special compiling my most played favourites etcjst phenomenal ,1
can access all genres of music  with spotify,1
been using this app since 2019 the app that i will always install and never uninstall because as an audiophile even if i use the free version it answered my music needs when it comes to listening to music i also love the part that aside from a listener you can also be a creator too,1
it is april 2022 and it still has the same problems as last year what is the use of offline downloads if you can not access them when youre offline why am i still getting ads even though im a premium subscriber how is it you can pay joe rogan 100 million dollars but refuse to fix this buggy app does it take the another class action lawsuit for you to act and do your job,0
i really dont understand how one of the biggest music apps on the planet can be this buggy frequently missing the now playing tab at the bottom of the app which means all controls skip pause etc are missing randomly says no internet connection while clearly connected to the internet and streaming if you search for a song and play it then let it autoplay similar songs afterwards you cant go back and listen to the original song without backing out and selecting the song again,0
its really good app because in the traveling we can listen many playlist,1
very nice selection of music,1
dear spotify why do i get songs that i didnt put on my playlist and why do we have shuffle play,0
ihave enjoyed this app but i think u need to make an option to download a song,0
useless only good on pc where it actually shows video  whats the point of it on the phone if its only capable of producing audio  ,0
its good but there are lots of ads,1
i use this app multiple times daily this might actually be my most used app spotify is amazing and has an extremely large collection of music,1
amazing and easy to navigate contains about 95 of songs you want awesome features however if it could have a smarter search that would pick up on key words like google that would make it that much better,1
adds are very disturbing  sound quality isnt that great also cannot find many favourite songs or they are visible but cant be played,0
the greatest music is here on the app,1
i already cancelled my subscription in early may 2022 but at the end of the may 2022 they still deducted the subcription fee through my credit card its a total scam i want refund,0
since the last upgrade 62822 spotify no longer works,0
awesome service i hope everyone supports spotify they need a better filtersort system,1
i only have it so i can listen to songs they took off of youtube music trash compared to youtube premium rip off musicians and buy rights to songs so nobody can listen to them,0
i like spotify very good application,1
you cant fully listen to songs anymore without having to pay,0
nice app you can download songs for offline listening found almost every songband i listen to and thats not pop but even rock metal atc,1
works fine on mobile if im on wifi no matter which one it just wont load anything i tried everything the app has all permissions still nothing,0
the music is great and i love the made for you playlists but the app always seems to qlitch lately sometimes it wont play through android auto it randomly stops playing and im always having to uninstall and reinstall the app,0
the feature i like the most is the timer it enables me set a timer for 5 to 1 hour or to the end of the track and sleep other than that i wish i could find more songs other than the known and english ones because its sometimes hard to find some specific songs in other languages eg arabic,0
its better once u have premium but theres better apps that u can use instead of not having premium,0
plz fix this app totally a mess not even a single song could be played its just a mess im done of reinstalling for many times and face the same problem all playlists are empty and cant listen to a single song ,0
spotify is it a glitch when i click the song i like a random music will turn on or when i click the music it doesnt play full song please spotify fix it i really need some songs,0
that app is fine except when you click on the video to get 30 mins free of ads but then 10 mins later you get 3 ads in a row,0
vad,1
sick of spotify blaming their awful service on customers with high expectations oh you are sorry the service didnt work as i expected it to i guess it was too much to assume that your garbage app would do anything it said it would just like you corporate clowns my bad keeps getting worse and worse right on the cusp of canceling id rather have no music than deal with this headache,0
awful spotify enables annoying features like autoplay without telling you also after completing the song you were listening to it gives related songs that arent even slightly related to the original genre best yet you cant even disable it no matter how hard you try there are some ways to fix this but thats just so much hassle to basically just listen to a regular ol music player on loop,0
i love spotify but this new update is awful it has too many bugs to the point where it wont show what song plays this update pretty much made it unusable,0
nothing to complain the app is clean and easy to use but hopefully the have promos for the long term subscribers as i have subscribe a few years ,0
my everyday go to for the music that keeps me sane,1
glade i come back hade created me new gmail because someone hack my one but wish that fix update for windows 11 or see that work app that work on laptop,0
stop those ads,0
like the play lists they set up for me based on the music i like,0
they charge me twice a month and wont stop when i ask them to terrible customer service,1
i get like 4 ads in a row before tow songs play and then 4 more ads,0
all the songs start from the middle not the start it was fine beacuse it only worked on some songs but now every song starts from the middle,0
was far better but new update awful glad the player returned so can pause and skip again but now when in car and get a whatsapp message or a call theres no way to get it to continue playing the song following the alert as it used to only reason i subscribe is to listen while im driving if this isnt fixed i may as well cancel my subscription,0
in my opinion its dumb that you cant pick what ever song you want to listen to without premium you might aswell use youtube unless they change it,0
this is truly the best streaming app out there starting from all these personalized playlist podcasts daily mixes  easy to use they offer so much even without premium amazing ,1
i get ads longer than a minutes before and after every song i play its ridiculous usually i got ads after 4 to 5 songs these ads are very annoying please reduce the number of ads,0
spotify is awesome i love having any obscure artist i can think of at my fingertips as well as easy access to newer things update lost a star for constantly asking for a review ive already done,1
frustrating app continues to over ride other streaming apps no matter the settings,0
extremly slow and unresponsive s7 android 80 once i open the app i sometimes have to wait up to 1 minute for the search option to work if its working altogether,0
really like it quite intuitive,1
why i cannot payment for premium after upgrade apps,0
suddenly the app bugs and i get lost for wanting to use the most basic features find the player unblock a song etc i have to restart the app to find it again not expecting that form the biggest music streaming app,0
i love spotify i will use this app for my music forever all the time 247 i dont care about the other apps this one is for me and i love it,1
installed this on my phone today it wont allow me to login to my account i am getting a head ache now from too many attempts to fix this really disappointed uninstalling the app from my phone and smart watch never had an experience like this from other music apps now its saying i cant login due to too many attempts i even changed my password thanks a lot for ruining my pre workout mood i would have bought a premium version if there was one,0
full of add and there is no clear history option otherwise its good app to listen more music,0
im greatful that even if you havent subscribed yet they still play some of my fave songs everyone need a spotify music in this lifeeeeee ,1
cannot go back always stucks on loading screen not fixed for a quite long time now music stops suddenly and it is not possible to go to the now playing screen,0
the app can be a little buggy at times but apart from that it is awesome allways have spotify playing music and the sound quality is great,1
best app on the music streaming platform,1
i wanna restart my playlist but it dosnt let me go to the new song and just makes me listen to the last one that i was listing to and it sucks and makes me frustrated,0
love it buthate that i cant cancel my subscription and it is on auto pay and i cant turn it off,0
so many issues lately music player disappearing music stopping when phone blacks out very annoying and hard to keep using,0
i love this app its the best one ive found it works on  off life suggest new music shows some videos easy to manage  no limit on download yet its affordable and has several different settings for house car or bluetooth highly recommend i havent needed anything else for music,1
awful i switched to the usa version of the app and it says to buy premium to skip as many songs you want tothere are many more problems with the app i mentioned this problem only that clearly doesnt make any sense spotify was better back in the day but now its trash rather than waiting for a new update where they fix all of this get a better app,0
great for the most part can be repetitive and many commercial breaks if not purchasing any monthly service plans beggars cant be choosers ,0
kuch rimix song bhi diya kro,1
i absolutely love spotify no other musicpodcast app compares i have zero complaints,1
wow it really is an amazing music app love it theres all the songs i like but just one thing that theres some songs that doesnt have lyrics but anyways i would recommend that all should try this app,1
fantastic app subscribe very intuitive and excellent content listen to joe rogan all day long malone interview is very informative we should be ashamed of our medical industries tyrannical ambitions,1
app has been starting to be buggy my problem that i am experiencing is that offline mode does not show my downloaded songs but when i go online it says they are downloaded please fix this issue,0
i love this app its amazing and has good music 1010 would recommend,1
bro fix the login first then come to ads,0
i really love the app very easy to use ui theres almost no limit to the customization of playlists and your qeue overall an amazing experience,1
i used to be able to quickly filter through my liked songs by scrolling through the alphabet on the right hand side of the screen it seems with recent updates that this feature has been removed for some reason as i have over 1000 liked songs this leads to endless scrolling until i get to the song that i want please reprogram this filtering option,0
the app is nice and all but whats annoying is that it wouldnt play the song i selected it always played a different song i would reccomend if you like listening to randomly selected songs,0
this app used to play music for me from my playlists or just by simple searching now it plays either adverts or a small sample of my song not the entire thing safe to say unless they update that to change it back i wont be using spotify again,0
the whole shift towards restricting freedom of speech and being influenced by neil young and joni mitchell deters me from the joy of selecting entertainment based on my likes and desires im ending my subscription and moving to tidal or other service otherwise it was wonderful until then,0
spotify app is nice app  i enjoy this app,1
this is the worst podcast player everything is harder than it should be,0
best music app out there its like youtube except you can listen with your screen off if you actually have patience and dont throw fits like toddlers through the ads its a great app,1
super ,1
it has entertaining games for my kids,1
its a worst application they show to many advertisements after each song play worst experience,0
excellent music player,1
please fix latest update constantly skips songs every couple seconds when you connect it to a bluetooth device,0
excellent app with plethora of music,1
please remove the free plan as it is very mediocre things jumps to your playlist you skip 6 times an hour that is just useless,0
this is really frustrating the app was all good in my tab a few weeks ago but then all of my playlist and downloaded songs wont appear even while using wifi i cant even play any playlists saying its all empty whats the sense of paying premium if i cant even access my offline library or play any music you need to fix this asap,0
the music keeps cutting out every couple of minutes on my brand new phone and did on my previous phone ive reinstalled and updated the app many times what else is there to do to fix this issue actually the music now stopped while writing this feedback lol smh,0
the best app for music lovers you can find,1
great station love the music keeps me going,1
just awesome ive been with spotify for years,1
best app it has become part of my daily routine listening to music on this app amazing app,1
would give 4 stars because it randomly skips the rest of a podcast episode in the middle of it and you lose your spot not very often maybe once every 8-10 hours of listening but they threw neil youngs threat to force censorship right back in his face and thats hilarious 55,0
this is by far my favorite music app ,1
so because this app uses google maps i cant use it google says my house still doesnt exist after 8 yrs of trying to get it fixed and being told its easy until spotify starts using an app like what3words that can actually be used to navigate no stars unless it wont give me that option google needs to call a business owner 14 times a day to confirm a business exists maybe not the best choice for spotify to use,0
hi ive been trying to subscribe for premium now for a while each time i keep getting payment failed theres nothing wrong with my card cause ive used it on both yt music and tidal,1
the most schizophrenic app ive ever used suggestion spotify please lean hard into the woke so i can delete you,0
nothing to say about this spotify app just i like songs,1
the thing i love about spotify is if you have something youre listening to and you listen to it can you come back the next day and listen to it again i just love this app and it has every song you can think of,1
like the discover weekly playlist more of this please,1
app is constantly crashing and doesnt play songs anymore,0
superb sound quality and vast collection,1
not a good experience at all  i would like to know why my card is billed from this service because i never joined this service ever  i sent an email to cancel after this payment came out on my card  to find out how and what is happening and no response,0
you can find any song from any artist well if theyre on spotify of course youll be able to find them the app is great for custom playlists and personal features to custom your listening experience highly recommended,1
unacceptable starts playing randomly on my phone for no reason 20 times a day i have to delete it and install again when i want to use it otherwise it just just starts playing anytime,0
one of the best music streamingplayer it could be 5 if has family feature in vn,1
great when it works havent had too many issues on the pixel 6 pro control bar is missing with latest update,0
good selection and making my own playlists is perfect,1
not all music can be played and they not update all the music everyday,0
it has stopped playing i push play and it does nothing ongoing all day 5-29 i tried uninstalling and that did not work,0
lol music quality is good but the ads are just kinda annoying and when im sleeping and listening to spotify the ads are just kinda really annoying in my phone theres no repeat for the song since i always like my music in repeat for other i dont know i guess they have the repeat button but i dont have the repeat song button so yeah i only hibe it 4 stars,0
had spotify for years but lately its almost unusable i regularly update my phone and the app but it refuses to play selected podcasts or songs often randomly pauses playback constantly forgets where you have left a podcast if this continues i will just cancel my family subscription after a good few years of use,0
great all around amazing playlists endless artists and almost endless variety,1
to many ads,0
so money hungry forcing me to pay premium just so i can skip more songs and listen to the ones i want listen too smh,0
deleting this app because apparently the distribution of anti-science propaganda for money is more important to spotify than music bye,0
spotify has helped me to enjoy music while dancing with my kids working out cooking and getting to sleep thank you,1
come on scrolling through months in liked songs was really convinient if you dont remember where the song is but remember when you added it also it brings you back to cool memories of your past and i also miss fast scrolling  please return it,1
i love spotify and i swear by it normally but the bugs are so annoying now the player disappears the music stops when i lock my phone or open a different app and the app crashes all the time,0
the new version updated of spotify is not good because in their they asking premium we cant go back and not get freedom to change the music with out premium if its gone in this way the people will not use this aap they will be gone for other aap,0
plays ads after app is closed and you need to force stop it so many ads,0
overlay no longer works only way to see whats playing is to kill app and restart,0
were always making changes and improvements to spotify to make sure you dont miss a thing just keep your updates turned on,1
very nice aap,1
wonky with sd card no easy way to manage downloads or see how many songs you have downloaded no good way to true shuffle through all your songs,0
ive been using spotify for over 5 years for a reason it quick its reliable my only complaint is with no warning some songs are removed and i can no longer listen to them,0
the app was perfect when i downloaded itit was very fun to useafter somedays of using it shuffles the song automaticallyand it plays random songs that i dont want to heari cant play the song that i want to listenit was a great appbut after this problem started i am getting irritatedand i tried to redownload itand it still has the issue so i dont even wanted to give a starjust the problem nothing else,0
joining someones session is a challenge now i can use the link they can send but i no longer get the option to join without playing music from my device,0
spotify has just completely stopped playing any songs at all full signal on my phone i started a song  let it sit for over 30min with not a single sound or a second played im not happy,0
love it so many options my girlfriend and i love to fall asleep to a podcast,1
i was a passionate user of tidal that if you own audiophile gadget it really sounds better than spotify but spotifys library playlists type almost whatever and the list exists  artist selection algorithm is galaxies more robust and further more now posseses cd sound quality which is an ok compromise from tidals sound,0
easy app to use and search for your favorite tunes,1
best app,1
new to spotify and love it if you are thinking of subscribing and you are a music lover do it its amazing,1
i love this music app this is the only music app that i use and will only use,0
premium subscription price is stupidly high,0
out of nowhere it wont let me play any podcasts or episodes on my alexa devices i can only play music i have tried all the steps they advised and still nothing is working i am not happy to delete my account and create a new one as i have many personal playlists i dont want to lose,0
every time i want to use this app since the latest update i have to uninstall and reinstall it because the play button stops working please fix it,0
i love this app i use it every day and night some much options from music to podcasts what i love the most is able to create my own playlists find some already made one of the apps i am never getting rid of the family plan is perfect as well,1
frustrating past few weeks app will force close now playing bar disappears saw this was a known problem last update fixed this but now its back again makes it really tempting to switch to a different service,0
great personal selection interesting how it knows,1
ive been thoroughly enjoying it so far except for the fact that no matter how much research and app searching i do i cant find how to rearrange my playlists it just does not work thats the only thing that lowers this from a 4 or a 5 to a 3,0
spotify is amazing,1
its an amazing app im using it since 2020but nowadays i cant see the lyrics below the songidk why i literally uninstalled the app twice but still even i signed out of my previous account just because of this issue and created a new one but still  idk why ,0
you cant play what song you choose because it shuffles it with random songs,0
on my galaxy s22 this app is unreliable at best podcasts drop off or the app crashes and i cant stop the track and spotify doesnt remember were i was inside of the podcast its not usable,0
i didnt like i dont like the automatic update  now without premium how to one song on repeat this new updatenew version 8744968 is sucks,0
best music site ever great selection and can listen to entire albums thank you,1
latest update in early april 2022 has made this app unusable,0
the app is always messing up i hate paying for this when all it does is not work,0
will not let me listen to my playlist with out adding other songs to my playlist,0
worst music application out there do not install do not use,0
easy to navigate and so many songs,1
op but there should be 10 sec forward button in phone version too and why discover button is not available for me anymore,0
if i cant change the theme of my lyrics at least give me nice themes because your current themes are very boring,0
as others have stated since an early may update i can no longer use the app on my phone despite multiple re-installs and storage switches i cant see any of my playlists and if i try to search it goes to a black screen same when tapping on a song or artist have been paying for premium for over 10 years now this is the first time i have ever had problems but this is unacceptable,0
my network is fine but it doesnt download and says no internet connection,0
longtime user spotify used to be great now its super buggy it will randomly crash every few songs,0
good aps,1
pretty nice i think u would have already got what i meant to say here extremely nice app u can use resso which is also similar to this and actually the sound quality is also the best there,1
its auto close and i dont know why,0
after update spotify start laging when we play a song it takes a second to start the song,0
outstanding enough for me to move away from amazon music   ,1
since last update stops playing playlist and restarts when i press play or just stops and exits,0
my fav app 4 music 3 i love how there isnt too many ads,1
this is an nice app for taking musices fun and happyness,1
an incredible diversity of music and such that i love but what i do not like is the music that is sometimes listed is actually rerecorded or remixed and not what i remember on the radio i want originals or not at all that is dumb furthermore negative podcast and misinformation and character assassination has no place anywhere in our world must have truths and facts based on science spotify needs checks and balances and must work harder on being above reproach and transparency,0
i love spotify and highly recommend it still loving it ,1
strongly pushing for subscribers free version used to be decent and now barely useable with ads at every step switching screens changing playlists between each step pausing and restarting any step so much that i finally signed up with premium trial premium is great tried to find an alternative with as playlists and songs and it doesnt exist yet not sure ill pay yet or find a youtube mix or listen to radio after the trial,0
best choice i ever made was to download spotify,1
better it got more free songs than amazon,0
newest update deleteing even more features,0
spotify is usually 5 stars when its working correctly latley when i open the app and start playing a song podcast or anything even though i can hear the songpodcast it says nothing playing this is annoying since i dont have the option to pause or skip parts of a song or anything the only way for me to fix it is uninstalling and downloading i really dont want to stop using spotify so please fix this thanks,0
is good but make it to be eble to search every thing and downloade,1
tv function is awesome  song with written lyrics function is very awesome  thank you for giving us such a beautiful experience and interface to interact songs world ,1
would have loved to give it 5 star but their payment system in bangladesh is kind of a mess ive tried local debit cards from 2 banks none of them worked and their support couldnt gave me a solution also they should introduce mobile bankingmfs payment like nagad bkash rocket upay etc in bangladesh theyll get at least 5 times more subscriptions if they introduce mfs payment in bangladesh i will update the rating to 5 star if they do this,0
good however introducing dolby and lossless streaming will be better,0
very good app for listening music at anytime 101 out of 100,1
great app to just let music play with screen off,1
please move the play button back in the middle,0
absolutely great app and so affordable and literally has any song any podcast  tailor made recommendations just for you - so awesome however if multiple devices are using the account only one device can listen at a time - probably some profit scheme to get people to pay for their own individual accounts k bye ,1
awesome playlist organizer and easy navigation,1
every time something changes in this app it means i go to community pages to find how to workaround something that spotify have broken this time around the app stopped evolving long time ago and now it just slowly degrading,0
offers a lot of music that i likei just hope they will lower their prices for the premium feature,0
im about done with spotify no matter what i do the songs are always in random no matter what i do and its pissing me tf off im paying 10 for service of random music ive contacted the company regarding this and its always the run around uninstall reinstall i did  goto settings  did that also and nothing changed this is probably my last month of using this service time to start handing my money over to amazon or youtube,0
after the last update the application cannot be used approximately every 15 seconds playback stops for 1-2 seconds sometimes more this way it is not possible to use the service at all,0
since updating my phone to android 12 when playing music with phone locked it stops and starts on its own also since the latest version of the app came out i no longer have an option to run car mode to keep the screen awake pitty really paying monthly and having issues wow,0
downloaded this app just for the joe rogan podcast a good podcast and along the way i have found several other is several other podcasts that i am enjoying,1
spotify used to offer the best musical experience now theyre more interested in misinformation campaigns,0
spotify is a good service but i have so my trouble with the app crashing playing when paused not showing that anything is playing when it is playing more crashing ive reinstalled the app to fix the problem then itll come back fix the app,0
ive tried other platforms and spotify is hands-down the best,1
this app has become incredibly buggy of late if i try to open a podcast it keeps taking me to my homepage other bugs recently which affect playback and not being able to search through 12 year user but actually considering leaving at the moment,0
better than yt music however why when listening to an artist album youre forced to listen to songs from another artist that is entirely different i would like to keep listening the same artist also why is there a limit to skip tracks if you add random irrelevant tracks,0
really not enjoying this new update  please bring old spotify back i use this app on my tablet which has a huge screen now the app is displayed as smaller than the whole phoneor tablet i cant imagine using this on my phone very sad and very upset old spotify was way better adding on this app still sucks  actually sucks more now where the hell is my side scroll  stop taking wonderful features around from this app yall suck,0
nice app but the ads is very disturbing,0
niceee,1
with just a small monthly fee im able to get access to all the albums ive ever dreamed of listening to,1
pros it typically has the songs your looking for typically has good audio quality and balancing the suggested music is typically relevant to what your listening to currently and you dont have to listen to them on shuffle and can backtrack music ifyour a free listener now cons the free to listen experience still feels purposefully miserable in order to make you pay to use basic functions you can use normally on pc and way to ad heavy,0
the only reason why i give it 4 and not 5 is because it adds to many songs to my playlist and it doesnt give me enough skips to skip them so i get stuck listening to songs that i dont like and that i never even heard,0
new update screwed up a bunch of things such as my library doesnt have the ability to search alphabetically on the right scroll and the genres are glitched overlapping and the new sample videos on certain songs are just a waist of battery,0
a great app to listen to your favourite music ,1
it a good place to listen to music and watch podcast,1
great app but advert after almost every song unless you sign up for premium which unfortunately i am not in a position to pay for that atm due to financial issues ,0
spotify often gets logged off especially when we get into car and start driving music will not work and we will have to stop and login again login without password functionality often does not work eventhough link says its valid for 4 hours it says expired when tried couple times it says too many attempts,0
i love this app i am so very happy ad free music,1
if they dont support the constitution i am out i removed all apps from my devices return all covid related items back to spotify your not a publisher,0
i mean its a great app to listen songs with but there are some issues going on when i play songs i couldnt rewind a certain part of it though i was able to a few days ago why is it that the shuffle buttons are gone like the buttons where if you tap it itll replay the same song this app is confusing seriously i just want to listen to songs thats it,0
i love spotify but i just wish the liked songs i have would play more often than the ones that i dont like as much i feel like some of the songs i have that i liked dont play as much i thought of a decent idea of having a love button and like button so the love button makes the song play more often but after reading this it kinda sounds like a dumb idea but i dont know also i wish it would open the app to my library and not home and it would ask me for uninterupting music more often,0
lot of ads ,0
i love this app its great for music and its very easy to use i would recommend it,1
clear music havent looked for a song they didnt have,0
best app i have ever seen yes there are always some pros and cons like it has my things like we can create our own playlists even they also make new playlists for us but it also has advertisementswhich i can say is valid cause we dont take the subscription so its fine but one thing i just want to highlight is please add the shuffle feature so we can shuffle our songs its kinda boring to listen the song in same order,0
sahil sh,1
had some problems with iphone back to android ok,0
this app is great it has almost every song i really enjoy def a 5 star rating,1
pls im fine withe the rest just fix the playpause forward and backward button it was fine before now it just triggers me cause a its not symmetrical b it doesnt even match the much better design when you visit the queue stop making the ui ugly and worse there wasnt even a good reason i could think of that you guys would do that,0
i had used iheart radio for years i will no longer use iheart due to them pushing their gay agenda on their users i got tired of gay ads every 10 minutes i switched to spotify and hope they are better,0
ive been experiencing lots of little bugs lately sometimes it resets my progress on a podcast sometimes it marks a podcast as played when i only listened to five minutes it doesnt communicate with my car very well anymore so the radio display shows the first song in a playlist and not the current song i have to close and restart almost any time i switch devices when it works it works great but i hope they get this stuff working again soon,0
cant play the song i want to hear im on the song but below is a smaller bar with a different song and it plays that instead theres nothing i can do to get the song im in and want to hear too play,0
love spotify just wish premium was a little cheaper,0
fantastic music any time,1
awesome app just reduce the number of ads,0
its always been slow to load for me but since the last update its also really unstable stops playing randomly or plays with tiny interruptions which make it impossible to listen at times please fix i am paying for my account and i expect a decent product,0
im a premium user and have been for a few years now sometimes it works flawlessly but half the time i open the app im waiting for it to remember that it is in fact connected to the internet and then im waiting for it to search for something that i listened to recently only for the search to come back empty or ill be trying to get spotify to play something through a google device and it will completely freeze the website works well but the app is far too glitchy to be useful,0
very best app and best sound,1
the new update is broken i have to constantly close and reopen the app to refresh it it wont show what current song is playing its very glitchy and slow it has worked perfectly before,0
sessions on joined devices are kinda buggy not the one in the sand lmao the listen on same device dialog is missing therefore they output the music on the joined devices as well,0
once im offline for a while my music dissapears and i cant listen to anything until i go back online,0
the last time i updated this app it crashes everytime i press the play button it doesnt play the song it always exits everytime i play a song will you please fix this i am on a premium account and i dont deserve this kind of service thank you,0
i have downloaded the app and it is helpful to me cause i love musici wish i could get the app again it helps me a lot i love the app ,1
i dont like the new update because you just have to get prime change a couple things like to turn off shuffle and to turn on replay,0
good music collection recommended to learn from the yt music suggestions algorithm which gives a really good variety of songs,1
amazing app i definitely recommend it although there are lots of ads u will find every single song here,1
could be better via lyrics search in the search box there could be a search lyrics i spend my time going out of app and into google search and back into app a pain especially at the start also when u listen to someones playlist be cool if there was a function to dislikenot like a song like there is in other sections just so u dont have to go over the same song a few times otherwise very good since update on 5 april there is no pause or stop button so i cant stop the music playing,0
spotify gave me the opportunity to make my first play list ever i love it,1
this app works great at the first time but after linking few songs it start with something that i dont understand serious i think you need to update your app,0
i have a minor issue actually when you are playing games spotify will not play music even i turned music of in that game and finnally can you reduce the amount of adds,0
one,1
what has happened to this app where has the now playing screen gone no way to control whats happening on the app anymore i cant rewind i cant skip the inbeded grifter ads by the podcasters or rewind and listen to something interesting,0
it doesnt let me in because i dont meet the age acquirement,1
please dont add to our playlists please i love the app nonetheless,1
uhmm this app is best app ever the only thing is there are too many ads and if you ask me to get premium im not affordable and pls can you provide translation for all songs in your app,0
so many ads i went to listen 150 minute song but i had to listen 1 minutes 9f ads what the worth gaana is better the you im shifting,0
great app i love that i can listen to so many artists and their albums in one place also love that i can wake up to music when i set my alarm,1
excellent streaming service,1
the best music app i have ever seen,1
i had a very good experienceyou can make your own playlist for different songs and if you dont know what you want to listen to it will give you already categorized wonderful songs and it gives original songs so far the best place to listen and search for songs,1
fabulous bye bye cd lp  cassette collection of 1000 albums hello unlimited music ,1
been with spotify since it was just a little niche startup bye now time to uninstall now it is a platform for racist fakers,0
new bug player is not visible in app or notification bar crashes after a few minutes of playtime unusable in current state please fix,0
my music keeps pausing and resuming even when i ha e good cell signal it makes the app useless,0
i start a song on my playlist the music plays but the option to pause play stop skip etc isnt there just started happening recently fix it,0
its a good app although i logged out of my account so my friend could do something on her account cuz her phone died but when i tried to log back in it said my account doesnt exist im still logged into it on my playstation and im putting in the exact info like username and everything on my phone but it still says it doesnt exist,0
my daily energizer ,1
love the spotify they have all the music i love,1
i can listen to all my music easy to use ,1
latest version will glitch where there is no pauseplay control bar in screen or notification i have to close the app and reopen for it to appear again,0
because you can listen to music and they fixed all the stuff and i love this app very much thats why i gave it a five star rating ,1
good thanx the best thing that holds my music taste,1
not working with wifi networks,0
i really like the audio quality the music sounds so crisp and clear the liked songs playlist allows you line up all your favorite hits like a personal juke box,1
new update cant connectstream spotify in my pioneer car head unit grrrrrrr,0
good service other than being perfectly fine with spreading misinformation and people being killed by that it misinformation,1
very good application for listening music free ,1
pay 1199 for a premium membership mixes the same 20 songs in various different daily mixes every now and then will have a single new song if you play that app has no similar songssuggestions plays one song only so you need to go back and choose a playlist for those same 20 songs so annoying while you driving same story of you search for a song no similar songs to continue playing music going back to youtube music after this month,0
the application was telling me to enter to my accounti have my account connected to my facebook accountbut it did not let me enter to my account because there was an errori decided to connect my account with my gmail account and when i opened my account of spotify all my playlists where gone i try to ser if i could recover it on the website and nothingit was 2 years of compilations and everything to hell thanks spotify,0
spotify sucks now i have to hear other song i i dont like because of the shuffle soundcloud is better because it has less ads no forced shuffle it might be more complicated on soundcloud but spotify makes you buy premium that why i never going to buy it yall just want more money dirty rats ,0
im in awe that i have to pay a subscription just to turn off the shuffle on mobile app this just tells us that your money hungry,0
increase audio quality then you get 5 stars,1
ads over ads over other ads on top of some more ads under other ads only 6 skips per hour have to trial songs in order to hear what i like your to gready and it shows not for me  good bye,0
bring back the heart now i cant see my favorites in a plays list anymore oh and apparently i can only add a song one times now like seriously i have really long playlists and i wanna be able to add my favorites many times,1
spotify is by far the best way to listen to the music you love to stream and its free and premium allows you to keep your downloads and listen to them offline with premium amazing,1
ive had money in my acc for spotify for aver a week spotify never took its money and netflix did so now i dont have money for this,0
great app of course but theres a new bug since about a week the play bar at the bottom disappears or never even appears at all same with the music card in my notification shade bt buttons then dont work either music does play and there is no lag but if i want to skip a song i have to clear the app about once or twice only to lose it again after some half hour op7pro it even begins to quit around twice a day during studying needing me to restart the app,0
the best music is right here on spotify i love it awesome,1
its a wonderful app but they need data to save your music playlist,0
for some reason music keeps going on and off and sometimes it just turns off until i turn it back on,0
i cand see the song that i am playing i dont see the player i cand pause cant go back what the hell happened,0
app is good but it cant show lyrics for songs on local files and app closes on application swipe from recent,0
very wonderful app u can hear all kinds of language songs here really loved it ,1
in my opinion spotify is very good and relaxing and calm,1
the best music app  and surprisingly cheap  not a bad way tho,1
spotify doesnt stop playing when alarm goes on,1
edittrial endedmake a play list then it gets filled with bs and then limit 6 skips per hour very strange good for podcasts though,0
great music selections in any genre,1
after recent update music keeps pausing automatically when trying to play on an alexa speaker,0
love,1
the app keeps on crashing it closes automatically i cant play any musicsong even though im in a premium plan i performed all the troubleshooting but it still didnt resolve my issue my phone is vivo v2025 that runs on android version 12 this is the only app that is crashing on my phone the rest are working perfectly fine i checked the spotify support and it seems all customers that are under vivo phones are having the same issue please fix this i dont want to waste my premium plan,0
im not sure if this is from a recent update or what but now whenever i leave my car the music will continue playing on my phone and all controls have disappeared they disappear from the whole app when it is launched disappeared from my lock screen preview and disappeared from the top drop-down menu this is incredibly frustrating as it now requires me opening the app settings in android and doing a force stop galaxy a71 on android 11,0
music is good for what you like some dropouts in volume but bearable ads arent too annoying but if you dont want ads get the premium otherwise im happy with this service,1
i love listening to pat mcafee everyday and david spade thank you,1
after 2 or 3 song there is always ads,0
i find that im constantly having to close out the app and restart it because my play bar disappears i cannot control anything the app has also just randomly pausing this is especially frustrating when im driving,0
good,1
music constantly pauses by itself i pay premium but the service lately has been anything but has been doing this for a month now,0
its almost perfect i wish the play next button has crossfade mixing effect too id love that feature,1
one of the main reasons i got spotify is to listen to joe rogan i can listen to him for free but i have paid for a subscription as a way of supporting and saying thank you to spotify for allowing an open discussion on all topics and not caving to the immense pressure im sure they are under keep up the good work spotify team,1
just listen occasionally but i like the range,1
great to get back to all the old music  most of us have grown up with 60s 70s 80s 90s until now ,1
app never shows my most recently played music properly it doesnt link with my facebook right either and support says theres nothing they can do and the app is just glitchy spotify doesnt pay artists enough money,0
remove the likeunlike button from easy mistouchable places please i dont like to unlike songs by mistake when im scrolling through my songs or when i skips songs on the lock screen,0
the app worked fine for a few months but afterwards it started showing no internet connection even though my network worked just fine on other platforms i tried reinstalling the app but i couldnt login it kept showing something went wrong or network connection issue even though my net work was working just fine please fix this,0
i couldnt find some songs in spotify and some songs are not able to play ,0
spotify is a great app to use when you want to listen to music on the way to school or when your going from school it doesnt have a lot of ads because they rarely pop up,1
what happened now i cant play my favorite songs in my playlist how disappointing,0
its good but uses more data than i expected at first and some albums are not excluded,1
one of the least dependable most buggy apps on my phone every time theres an update to fix something two other things stop working if i didnt already have my entire library curated on here id just go back to pirating wouldnt recommend it to a new user,0
the best music app  period ,1
its so cool to finally find a music that everyone enjoys- thank you so very,1
the best place to get your music,1
the podcasting has been pretty bad with losing your place and altogether skipping to the end when you try to start it up making it completely un enjoyable for me to the point where i didnt listen but something seems to have changed in the last few days and things have worked normally so whatever you guys might have done good job,0
spotify is awesome  i love it by far beats youtube any day,1
amazing but slow at times,1
randomly pauses completely ruins the purpose of the app,0
love spotify  ive been using youtube which is wonderful selection also but the ad interferences break up the smooth flow music experience  spotify lets it flow without constant tending  nice,0
i loved this app but now not so much as the music keeps stopping and starting or sometimes wont even start again unless i close the app,0
spotify has the most amazing artist radios and so many different podcasts and every artist youve ever heard of i am grateful for this service and all that they do i hope they keep it up they make listening to music a joy,1
take off those stupids ads cant listen to 1 song without watching an ad for 1 minute straight stupidnessso hungry for money theres no such thing as customer satisfaction anymore,0
i really love spotify i can listened to any music that i want,1
i love this app ive used for a long time but recently i cant pause the songs unless closing the app and songs randomly stop playing i hope this gets fixed soon,0
it is only a good app if u have spotify premium,0
quality music just get the premium voucher and feel it ,1
nice to have a mostly easy app to use  save your music  cant beat the price either,0
honestly the apps greedy you have to listen to a whole playlist to just listen to one song you have to pay for premium for it and it has loadsss of ads its so unjoyable now pls fix this madness bro u cant even listen to music w out paying,0
i put five stars but if i have any issues then i wont hesitate to come back and gladly set it at 4 again ,1
best ,1
spotify is not working,0
it keeps on saying 14 days to use then brings me back to the login page over and over same with ps4,0
video randomly stops working playback failed message constantly work out your bugs so i can enjoy my podcasts and i will rate this app higher,1
best music app of the century,1
i use and pay for spotify but for some reason the app keeps soft crashing im listing and the music will stop momentarily then start but the player dose appear and ill have to restart the app i hope this gets a fix,0
wow is a understatement easy to work with very good motivational talks interactions with my car and other bluetooth devices is fantastic thank you,1
idk wt to say but tooo gud to be true but i gave 4 stars by of tooooooooooo many adds,1
not able to download it everytime i try it stops on 66 worst bug ever that also before downloading the app,0
excelllent work by spotify team keep it up,1
this appwhy are things always broken now that worked fine years ago i create a queue last night but today im in a different mood  click on a particular artists station only one song plays from their station before it defaults back to last nights queue why just because we wanted to sing loving you at 3am drunk last night doesnt mean i want that drunken memory overriding what i want to listen to today poolside why not an option after the app has been completely closed,0
its that normal i did pay this month my spotify then suddenly my gsm is on trouble so all application was uninstall and now i log in again all my song that i did save are gone and also my payment gone i need to pay again for membership,0
in my liked songs it doesnt allow me to play a song i wish to so i have to play it on shuffle and to add to that it only allows me to skip 6 times in an hr doesnt let me add songs to queue or even see what song is next this is all after the newest update which is honesty horrible because i do not wish to pay premium for features that should be available for everyone honestly speaking majority of music apps dont have such a thing and its disappointing on spotifys side to even think of this,0
i wish we can download the songs and please the management should add sleep timer option in the settings no other objections but the app is very good,1
its good when you can put together all the songs that you enjoy and just be able to listen and blast them when you are drivingdont even have to worry about the next song without having to turn it down and wait for another jam to come outyou just keep it goingespecially the hard to get kinda music,1
lovvee,1
its a very good music app but the one thing i dont like is how we have to pay for us to pick any song in any order and i dont know if its just me but i cant put any song on loop but its a good app,1
choice spot on ads are a bind but the nature of things do not overload,1
edit seems to be working better lately still randomly pauses which is disrupting edit uninstalledreinstalled bc it was acting up and now all my playlists are gone starting to lose interest in this app its very slow to respond lately too the force closing finally stopped but lately and just says im offline half the time and takes forever to load any of my playlist sucks because i really like using spotify but as of late hasnt been operating very well,0
good app just like the rest of the music apps ads are super loud which can be a pain,0
but in android there are some glitches and bugs while opening some times all works well except search and shows that no song matches,0
horrible app cant play any song i want instead i have to tap shuffle play  it gives me an ad everytime if we could play any song we want in whatever order we want this app would definitely be great other than that horrible app,0
what a ridiculous amount of ads nine in and havent heard a song yet  nine before i decided to come here and comment they are still going then once a song starts even if you dont finish it youll get an ad before the next one plays only one ad if you are lucky terrible app interface is lacking cant find songs easily enough they dont even pay artists very well no thanks,0
its an amazing music app but there is one big problem qnd its that the experience isnt really enjoyable without premium which not all people can afford so please make at least 2 of the premium features available for free,0
i dont know why but it will play every possible song but the one on my playlist i went to communityspotify to see if they had a fix for the problem but no matter what i do it just wont work note this has not happened before it just randomly became a problem one day ,0
why the hell this crashes everytime,0
spotify absolutely blows pandora out of the water never looked back,1
please add annual subscription,1
app keeps shutting itself off in the middle of songs,0
spotify is the best if you dont have premium then you have limited options but when you get premium it is amazing you can download and listen offline and play songs individually,1
works fine for the most part other than all my playlists take more than a minute to load even after clearing the cache and restarting my phone this problem is new and only started happening after the most recent update on feb 1st,0
enjoy the next 30 minutes of ad-free listening time to next ad 155 minutes this is a small issue but it errodes my trust in your brand and contributes to my hesitation about getting a premium subscription,0
without premium spotify isnt good and will never be good if you dont want to spend 10 for an actual good app just download musi,0
i made a playlist to have a list of my favorite songs not recommended songs all i wanna do is listen to my music not yours,0
excellent app for music i have spotify premium and i personally believe it is well worth the money i have discovered so much new music from recommendations in the app so i am definitely satisfied,1
its really annoying when the music doesnt have lyrics and like 70 of the time the lyrics arent there for the free users there too many ads and you cant even play it in shuffle order the only thing i like about this app is that theres a lot of good playlists already there and there are great podcasts and it has pretty good song recommendation,1
worst app they are forcing people to buy premium if someday didnt buy it they will showing ads continuously,0
you cant listen to a song with out going on a playlist and you cant start over the song,0
i dont have the canvas feature in my spotify even after uninstalling and reinstalling it i want that feature how can i get that,0
my app is not opening ,0
great love it for downloading songs occasionally misses out on more rogue remixes why not 5 stars far too buggy on my google pixel and windows laptop its buggy more often then not these days quite agrivating considering its my most used app scared now though i feel once youve got spotify you are stuck with it for life lol so say goodbye to 10 a month for the next decade aha,0
absolutely perfectthe best music app to useits fast and effectivei gave it five star beacuse i love itkeep up the good work,1
awesome app someting i love is the opcin to listen the local music,1
go,1
glitchy and not very intuitive to the songs i dislike as it will play them in all suggested lists even after i have removed them multiple times terrible experience lucky you have rogan otherwise its ,0
stays the best user friendly music app for me,1
best app ever super fast extremly useful and best music and podcast just about anything you can think of they got it and its completly free,1
always has what i am looking for,1
i adore spotify my only problem is that it doesnt allow you to deselect explicit songs not so good when youre listening to a recommended playlist in the car with the kids and explicit songs come on,0
they are really good and they also have a premium plan for 499 i use the family plan spotify has every song you would like,1
i enjoyed this very much this is the one of the best things that you can give to the people is what you have to hit let us hear i think its a wonderful beautiful thing to do for the people will do for me and the people this is an excellent experience this is an excellent thing to do for all of us i recommend this to everyone you guys do good work keep up with the work this is a beautiful experience to listen to what you have to offer us in music and anything god bles and in good healthvjd,1
very good i can find all my favorite songs ,1
well what does this app offer that needs rating it collects and plays the work of others well displays the artwork of others well its homepage is straight bad and mostly pushing things i will never and have never clicked on they should have a simple mode that gets rid of all the faff and lets you just listen to music after all it doesnt pay its artists so why does it need to advertise i already pay for it,0
login experience is not good here most of time i dont get otp and resend otp has some wating time  its sometime spoils the mood of hearing songs ,0
i use it everyday at least twice on my commute my liked songs playlist is huge i follow podcasts i never would have known existed i like the sleep timer i also love the daily lists made for me based off the songs i like listening to - this is how i find new songs similar in sound to those i already love i love this app it makes me happy and ill happily pay for it each month forever,1
easy to use and create playlists good recommendations and podcast choices only problem is the app sometimes has issues with lag and freezing but no other bugs otherwise,0
spotify is my favorite app for my music and i love it,1
needs patches desperately the app randomly disconnects from the playing song and refuses to pull up any song or podcast from the app without restarting,0
its ok but the thing is that there is add and its rlly annoying,0
pretty fantastic just wish theyd make song radios based off the cadence of the song its radioing rather than what other people that also like it also listen to d,0
spotify is great i must say the best music app ive ever loaded only thing i dont like is being unable to transfer my premium membership if original device is lost or stolen,1
easy to use and find music of almost every genre,1
please correct all the lyrics in every songs and add the subtitles ,1
it was very good until recently now its started to shut down on its own after a couple of hours and the shuffle option in your playlists is not working properlyalso it gets interupted if you are using the app on your phone conected to another device tv speakers i hope it is just an update maintenance glich and not a permanent thing,0
auto play is good very best app for music listening with less data if  ,1
i love the variety of all content i think that variety essential to any modern platform however i donot like any form of sensoring including pop-up politically motivated so-called warnings,1
i cant see folders containing playlists on galaxy watch because folders are not shown,0
the first download this music app everything is normal but  after some time when i turn on the offline mode some of album art not appeared please fixed this issues,0
they shuffle songs that can be offensive in wording without your consent other things are good but that is a conflict of interest sorry not sorry spotify,0
for general im satisfied except for one point there is no offline lyrics if i could see the lyrics for the songs ive downloaded that would be great i like the app though i will use it anyways but i hope developers can bring the offline lyrics feature soon,1
this new update is sucks it keep playing random song from playlist that we choose i more like the old one and im giving 4 star for this,0
with no excuses  this is the best app for play music ,1
love this app perfect for listening to my musical playlist whilst relaxing cycling or walking,1
enjoyably i love the variety of generes,1
its the best bug filled music steaming app simple to use and great price but the apps always full of issues if its not ignoring or changing your music download file location seems to hate sd cards the controls bar is not appearing cant pause skip etc have to clear the cache to fix,0
easy to use and best of all they support joe rogan which is why i bought the premium package,1
great app for music,1
has been great hate to say that too early though,0
everything good just do something for advertisement like after 20-30 minutes ad should come,0
its a great app for music but it will randomly change and i wont be able to listen to songs on theyre own without it playing a random playlist with that song nor can i put a song on repeat and its frustrating please fix this,0
my spotify mobile app skips more than my old walkman even when i have full signal friends send me links to songs for spotify and it never opens up to the song they sent me so i just have to look it up myself want to create a blend with me too bad it wont let me follow the link to join it spotify mobile is really garbage,0
ive been experiencing a few issues for a few months now which is annoying search not working entirely until app cache is cleared and restarted also music playing but the player not showing up,0
its an okay app reason i use this is because it has the original and remixed versions of songs without having to pay for itbut heres a few things i dont like 1 i made a michael jackson playlist and it added a ghostbusters song to it and i cant delete it 2 when i make a playlist i add a few songs and want to listen to more like them so i click similar it either shows the same songs or very little quantity of them 3 when im listening sometimes the song will just cut off,0
it would be amazing without the adds without having to buy premium although thats just me being cheap,1
i prefer spotify above all others because it has more english and foreign songs than other apps and even with ad included version this app is best i dont bother watching or listening its ads as i m a free user keep it up spotify ,0
all of the sudden i dont get sound coming from the left speakers in my car it only happens when in the car is this a spotify app issue car or both i have a 2020 hyundai tuscon,0
awesome music application fought using it over panora for years then was forced to do to getting a samsung watch love the fact that you can pick your songs way to go spotify im a believer ,0
5 stars spotify your the goat for fixing it lots of love never gonna stop using spotify my goto music sorce 100100,1
hey devops you killed the equalizer function with the latest update again bring that back in please highly utilized,1
thanks for this app i was happy to discovered many new underrated good song complete with the lyrics but sometimes i found the lyrics failed to load or just gone its always happen to unknownsmall artists song i wonder if you could fix that,0
this is the best app i use for listening songs but i cant download songs or playlists unless and until i purchase the premium version but thats ok at least this is better than gaana which used to take my whole 1 gb just to listen a small 20 songs playlisti suggest that this is the best app to listen songs to and it is really convenient for me when i have to listen only one artists songs they also have made special playlists for artists and also made genres of music,1
excellent app ,1
really really great app but could be better of we could download individual songs instead of having to put them in a playlist,1
i think getting lyrics from music match was a great move a lot of the lyrics are incorrect and some are incomplete the mah 2022 update has been quite glitchy often forcing the app to stop abruptly,0
it is best website for listening the music i use many websites like gana spotify is best website to use for listening the music,1
very nice good work but remove those ads,0
im not sure what you guys have changed but the app drops off the face of the earth now without warning thought it was my earbuds but i can listen to youtube music without any random drop offs,0
somebody connected to my account with a different email and i had no access to my playlists or account and no help from spotify to rectify the problem deleted the app,0
a simple easy to use very user friendly all build your playlist quickly and listen to your fav sing throughout the day,1
my experience with spotify has been pretty good over the past years but since the removal of being able to preview songs when adding them to playlists the app hasnt been as enjoyable to use im not sure why that feature was removed as it seemed to be helpful to a lot of other people too,0
the best damn music app out there try it or be stupid its up to you,1
best out there with great widgets and shortcuts,1
just recently i tried to choose a song then it automatically closes the app its been doing this for 3 days now ive even done a factory reset and thankfully it worked but then a pop up came for something about bluetooth for android 12 then clicked allow after that it did it again please fix this as soon as possible,0
one day i was listening to music and could not listen to songs i love only the suggestion ones witch i thought werent good i tried to listen to the ones i love in every way its no good the only way is to get premium witch cost money im not spending money to listen to songs im sorry spotify its a good app but i cant use it  but still i will give it a good rating because either way its a good app,1
i build lists of the music i love and explore new music without limits this is my best music buy in years,1
i know at free have ads but you need see how much ads you sharing i faced countinue more 5 ads thats why i am giving you only 1 start i dont know is that any problem or you are doing at know now you cant share any ads because i am going to delete this app,0
last few updates seem to have broken multiple features music more likely to randomly pause player bar no longer appears until i restart the app syncing between devices is also buggy,0
have never had any problems with spotify absolutely love it,1
great selection and sound,1
its great i love listening to music on it  it works great except the fact that spotify automatically stops working after playing two or three songs  can you help with that,1
having such an incredible experience music recommendations are spot on for me at least interface is easy to use the sharing option the ability to have playlists on screen locking playlists the clip that plays in some songs is a plus great ,1
i loved this app but recently when updated i cannot play songs from the playlistd that i made and when i press the play button it says that i get only 6 skips per hour i mean like what the hell i want to play the songs in an order i have set my self not mixed and whenever i play a song spotify premium keeps coming off im deleting this song until this is fixed until then bye,0
love it 1 they play a lot of deep cuts not just the stuff you hear on the radio i tried out a few of the other paid services and they werent as good,0
absolutely the best but if you cancel joe rogan i know at least 45 people will cancel their service including myself,0
terrible app cant even play the song you want when i click a song it plays something entirely different you cant do anything about it unless you have premium or you use a computer,0
excellent our whole 6 family have a package we all love it and we use it every day thank you,1
can download songs for offline playing,0
all of the music that i want to hear is here except one song gifts and curses by yellowcard i wonder why,0
best application for listening songs i have ever seen,1
ive had spotify premium since 2017 and its never failed to provide the right tunes when nessecary never need wifi to play a song spotify is the best,1
an app with an overpriced subscription should not have full screen ads,0
when ever i try to play a song app itself exit and a i m unable to play song,0
cant login to the app thought connect to internet there is this msg show no connection is avaliable,0
was there recently an update why cant i see the song thats playing why is it when i click on a song it doesnt show thats the one thats playing please fix this ,0
currently isnt picking up where i left off on podcasts plays an ad right when i start then jumps to a random spot in the podcast or changes to the next one used to work beautifully now not so much,0
endless rest music - love it thank you,1
best overall for music,1
i use spotify all the time i pay for the premium version and its worth every penny,1
have had pathetic experience of using the app recently even when i was logged in and all the songs from any of presaved playlist were played app showed no internet connection issue while i used to search for the very same reason i uninstalled and reinstalled the app as well but it didnt help i hope the developers look into this as a serious concern if not solved asap users might end up with other music streaming platforms which i already have been shifted to and have uninstalled the app,0
i mean the music in the app is good but i want to hear the same song over and over again but i cant i have to shuffle play and can only once and i cant replay the song ,0
i love being able to listen to music buuut nothing on the mobile app works right when i shuffle play my liked songs after a few tracks it plays stuff not in my list when i search for specific songs and click them it starts playing some random song,0
ads are quite intrusive  sometimes after watching a 30 second ad  when i shouldnt have to see another ad for half an hour  i get another ad after a few minutes which should not be the case the equalizer should be made available in a more easily accessible menu instead of the settings  as i have to go back to the app home page go to settings  scroll down and then click on the equalizer option to access it  which is quite cumbersome and unnecessary ,0
this app was absolutely unusable for the app to stop working kick me out of it multiple times in a span of a few minutes and having to delete and redownload it for it to work this app is ridiculously stupendously ingloriously stupid you cannot change my mind,0
i have premium but it still wont let me download songs for some reason,1
best music platform out there i enjoy it,1
have had it for years way better than pandora,1
went down the drain as the app updates rolled on the app got worse well once you took my playlist i had and took the shuffle feature away to what was left well on i go pandora wins,0
oke,1
most of the time this is my favorite work-out and music app i use spotify every day sometimes all day last week something happened where all it would play were ads super upsetting then miraculously it got fixed and now i can listen to spotify regularly thank you spotify this really is a great app lots of artists  songs to choose from,1
i shouldnt have to have premium in order to have an actual ui ever since if canceled my premium i have no ui to skip or play songs i have to close out the app in order to pause a song or podcast this is ridiculous for your app spotify do better,0
its a great app and all the music is good and you find what you want but the annoying thing is that when you search for a song you want to play and select it it starts playing other songs that you did not even want to listen to and you have to wait for all thoooseeee songs to play its very annoying please fix this plus when you make a playlist it starts playing other songs that arent in your playlist please fix these issues the are not making it user friendly enough,0
now playing bar hasnt worked in about two weeks so i have to open to the app to see what song im listening to or change songs this is fun to try to do while driving,1
very easy to use  navigate,1
good music and good shuffle play sometimes it pauses the music when i receive a notification good if you buy the subscription so glad i dont have to hear the ads anymore,1
please fix the update its so confusing i wanted to play some music but its a playlist i cant even play the song i wanted to hear ads are annoying so please fix this and bring the old spotify back the app was so good last month bruh,0
i love  this app  it has ads but not that level thats the reason and you can choose your favorite artist you can enjoy different playlist in just 28 mb and resso use 68 mb so i prefer spotify,0
easy and fast loads of selections,0
too many ads like gawd i know i have to pay for premium you dont need to give me three 30 seconds long ads continuously even once is enough,0
spotify will not play songs using google voice command it says it will play song but after a pause says something went wrong have reinstalled spotify and google apps and cleared cache on both but no joy reported awaiting fix everything on my phone is up to date galaxy s20fe,0
videos in car should be a toggle  if people feel like they cant handle video when connected to car bluetooth let people chose so annoying this comes and goes every other update,0
 navigation between the various screens within the app makes sense  when i click on a song to play from the search results the list stays on there for me so i could select something else to play if i wanted to - it doesnt disappear or take me elsewhere  continues to work in background and while screen is turned off  my phone is fossil old and yet it works on it isnt slow doesnt consume much battery  auto-plays interesting relevant music based on the track i start off with,0
app keeps crashing and the que at the bottom disappears this app needs to he fixed after the resent update,0
an excellent experience - streets ahead of amazon music just waiting for voice control,1
best music app there is,1
its been stopping in the middle of songs and i dont have the option of the now playing screen where i can skip and replay etc this is really annoying and im paying for it monthly if im paying for it i should at least have a choice,0
its the best music app in the world,1
100 the only acceptable music app to use,0
gives you ads a lot and you get like 10 30 seconds ads in a row,0
best app to stream music,1
app is great overall but it sometimes plays songs that arent in the playlist im in for no reason  and the amount of ads is retarded its not out of the ball park to get eight ads in a row,0
epic although i hate having to turn on private session every time i share my playlists by request not having every tune show up in friends notifications on fb,0
the comparison ive inadvertently done between spotify  tidal has come to an unexpected clear winner tidal may sound slighty better but spotify has more of the music i love and even if only free ive noticed spotify having more of what i love than tidals more limited lossless audio selection which disappointed me with its lack of my favorites this christmas,0
get rid of enhance that is the most annoying thing ive ever seen otherwise its a good app has a really wide selection of music and has podcasts,1
ive tried all of the other music apps and nothing compares to my spotify i always have it playing in my car at my house at the store i love having the offline option so i dont use much data,0
it is so amazing nad easy and all the playlists are so cool,1
love spotify great for all the family,1
has all the songs and bands i listen too,1
best music app but expensive,0
wow what a very good app it has all the music  that i want,1
this app is all around perfect i recommend to any and everybody that loves and enjoys listening to music,1
spotify has been a great bonding experience with my son as we explored music together it is probably the most used app in my familyhousehold we have a family membership and the kids tell me it is worth the money we have discovered tons of new music and artists using this app this app makes me feel happy,1
absolutely perfect - customer service superb - for someone who has a very eclectic taste in music - spotify is fantastic,1
if we cant download the songs for free then delete ur nonsense app,0
just cancelled youtube premium and switched to spotify premium i support free speech,0
user interface almost useless shows me what you think i should be listening to and makes it difficult to find my own stuff sometimes impossible to find the start stop controls especially since the last update looking for an alternative,0
songs say lyrics but no lyrics has ever shown trash wont keep paying if it continues like this,0
spotify working very bad connected via bluetooth in the car i have samsung galaxy note 10 plus bluetooth version - 50 a2dp the music constantly breaks stops and begins is there a solution to this problem,0
im generally satisfied with my experience with spotify other than the random times the app closes sometimes i can go 10 or so songs before the app randomly closes,1
hi spotify team fyi  some time back i use to like chand baliya song after listening to your aggressive advertising spaces i am feeling pukish about the song  but mraditya the singer   you have ruined your status because of this over aggressive marketing efforts i am sorry for my shrewd comments but its time to improvise cheers ,0
nice,1
ui updated now its like the rows but each row has 1 item in it like  if your gonna make it scroll down instead of across can you at least make the size of the album art fit,0
need to fix bugs it keeps displaying layoit without the song being played currently im unable to set sleep timer etc because of this even after closing and reopening the app sometimes cant reinstall ill lose all my downloads1000 this needs to be fixed,0
this apps really good i have the student package which is good cause i means im not paying too much the only bad thing is i cant seem to be able to sort my playlists on the app like by most recently added but i can on the desktop app would be really nice to add this feature please,1
i wish i could rate this app more but thats definitely not happening my experience with this app has been nightmarish considering all i wanted to do was listen to music first this app is about music right well in my case the music did not even play it would show it was playing but it wouldnt make any sound i can assure you this had nothing to do with my device volume as for the playlists they never even loaded this does not have anything to do with wifi either,0
constantly tries to ram music ive never heard or know i dont like into my playlists eventually it ended up purely random i would never ever pay money for an app on the odd chance it might improve the function i hate this app,0
they removed one of the features that i used the most and i hate it the preview the song before adding it to the playlist was what i used to add new music that was recommended to me by spotify now i see that its like hey you may like this song but now i have to add the song to my playlist listen to it and then delete it if i dont like it when before i could listen to like 3 seconds to know if its my kind of song  bring that features back,0
this app sucks never ever use it if you like to find specific songs all it does is play songs that you dont want,0
i love listening to the music on herethanks for sharing,1
the app is absolutely the best to use ,1
its a great experience with music,1
currently virtually unusable cant search for anything endless loading no results super slow and laggy yet its fully updated and ive tried restarting my phone update and now i cant even go away from the app and come back with the app working i literally have to restart my phone every time i leave the app and then want to go back to it this is ridiculous i pay for premium and this is not even close to reasonable,0
edit feature suggestion a lot of us are using spotify playlists for house parties with our friends it would be nice to have a mix songs option where the crossover would be more than 12 sec discovering new artists has never been this easy i would never be able to leave spotify its just too good however i would like to have an option to filter podcasts by language i live in the netherlands but i dont speak dutch so my recommended podcasts in dutch are pretty useless,0
good,1
used to love this app here recently it pauses my music and it doesnt let me skip songs and sometimes more times than sometimes it doesnt connect to my truck seriously considering trying the you tube premium,1
love the music but its horrible that you cant delete the search history of all time once i heard something it will always show up again if i search for something similar please change this this cant be a thing for such an amazing app,0
i use this appto relax with my fouvorite music,1
all the music i want and looking forway better then pandora,0
nice ,1
premium is the best thing since sliced bread for me nothing i could actually think of to improve,1
i use to like this app alot now i chose a song and dont have the option of pause forward or rewind if it dont get fixed soon i will cancel my subscription been with them for 5 years,0
its a good app dont get me wrong but i just hate the recommended songs feature that randomly plays i only listen to songs in spanish but for some reason this app decides that i would love to listen to justin bieber and country music i dont understand why it plays songs that i dont want to listen to,0
i think that its an amazing apo and you should download it if you love music,1
the miniplayer on the app was removed i cant shuffle pauseplay repeat or toggle to a section of the song awful update,0
still going strong l listen to spotify everyday where ever im at driving to and from home and work visiting family and friends camping fishing or just alone trying to relax time only thing that has changed is the price keeps going up but i love all types of music so its worth it,1
spotify still hasnt been fixed huh,0
spotify gives you any and all music that there is to listen to absolutely free and creates mixes based on the music that you listen to i highly recommend this app to anybody who likes musicwho doesnt like music this app also gives podcasts absolutely free that tell great stories if you like storiesagain who doesnt like stories did i mention that it was free,1
ankushpal,1
i love music ,1
im absolutely satisfied with spotify furthermore you are able to find original version of musics with their original cover as well ,1
this app is very hard to use why are there only 3 skips per day why are there so many adds in a music app so stupid,0
very soothing  and relaxing,1
hello sirmadam i really love this app but it dosnt work in my country afghanistan so i have criticism from you and your administratorship team because im waiting more than 2 years up to now please bring this app into my country thank you,1
recent update broken with this last update i have been unable to access any music it wont play anything it doesnt allow me to even play downloaded or even show my music or podcasts fabulous back to not sleeping well upset because its been fine for years and now that i rely on the stories and mediations to sleep now it decides to not work at all,0
with a good bluetooth speaker and spotify i dont need,1
love it great selections very extensive library found a lot of my favorites,1
very good appi listen to lots of music on hear,1
this app is terrific and its quite easy to use but sadly there are a few caveats sometimes the app appears to be broken due to it not wanting to play any songs from a different playlist i pick only works when i force stop the app and clear the cache,0
giving it a four star because of the ads free profile user may get ads but not to such extent that they feel frustrated and feel like uninstalling the app rather than upgrading to premium membership i would love it more and wont hesitate to give a 5 star if the ads are lessened to some extent,1
i enjoy your content very much please do not cave in and bow to the thought police like the rest of them,1
it crashes so often after few last updates guys pls fix it asap this amazing app loses a lot because of that pls contact me and ill provide more error details,0
the constant bugs are annoying for a service i pay for my songs will skip in their own all the time and its very frustrating,0
in tamil songs the lyrics are in english with incorrect spellings could you please correct it,0
me and my friend cannot seem to make a blend playlist the link just redirects us to the home screen of the app regardless of the link sender,1
you can hear any song you want to listen or podcasts,1
after new update it closes automatically while playing music in background,0
i am unable to listen to songs without internet even tho i have premium my spotify glitches when i want to do group sessions when i want to rewind or fast forward a track it just continues the play through as usual the only benefit is i can listen to songs in any order but of im giving up 6 a month thats with student discount and im not getting the quality of service i asked for then ill probably switch to amazon music instead,0
good choice and good service,1
random log out and when i log in again with the same email and password saying that my password is incorrect very enjoyable music player so i gave you my 1 star ,1
kinda cool that you can make playlist folders now really helpful when you have liked ones to save but dont want them clogging your area but the navigation bar bothers me i wish it was solid black again instead of being semi-transparent,0
keeps crashing after playing a song what a waste of money i paid for premium so that theres no interruption while studying but this happened,0
i love spotify it has so much good music but it needs to add more xxxtentacion songs,0
always good and easy to use,1
great app when it works sometimes it randomly chooses to redownload offline songs for no reason and other times those offline songs become completely unplayable this has been going on for years and spotify wont fix it,0
worst music app ever i built a playlist and the only option is to shuffle play used to be able to select any song i wanted not anymore way better on the pc than mobile,0
im having the same problems other people seem to be having atm the now playing feature is suddenly non existent so i cant skip through my playlist it also wont turn off when i turn off my bluetooth device it just keeps playing through the phone so the only way i can stop the music is by uninstallling the app im at the point of not really wanting to reinstall it because its so frustrating to use im also getting 3 - 4 second pauses in the middle of songs,0
it is outstanding app well done,1
updates downloads when i need it most i work in a manufacturing facility so it is very hard to get connection and i cant having my phone out too much on the floor its annoying to have to wait on it working and feel like my job is at risk cause my pre downloaded playlists need to re-download shuffle doesnt work plays same 20 songs out of a 40 hour playlist fix it please,0
very good,1
on my new phone google pixel i cant see the current playing so i cant pause go back or forward or get any of the normal additional information would be higher if fixed,0
i was a premium user one day and downloaded the song but i see the next day and those songs are not the same kind of vulgarity,0
the app is good but spotify isnt responding on peoples complaint and reports especially on twitter please respond on fans tweets because some song are unable to play in some playlist especially on todays top hit playlist edit song like money by lisa is currently unable to play spotify please fix this issue,0
love this app ive never had trouble when using it,1
best app for songs got every song i wanted and making a playlist is very easy,1
recently theres been alot of bugs player doesnt open up cant see which song im playing music suddenly stops have to restart multiple times,0
what in the bloody hell you cant skip a song if its terrible bad or just you want to limit of 6 fu spotify ill use apps that are not worthlesspoops you money sucking freaks,0
great  i can listen to my storys podcast at night and not have any intrusions  i  this app,1
when i was younger i used to dream about being able to access music as i can now so you could say spotify has made my dreams come true thank you rob,1
i am a premium user and to my horror i cannot listen to music offline after downloading the songs i chose i think if you list this feature as a premium feature it should actually work unless this was a lie to get people to purchase subscriptions i hope to get my money back i do not appreciate being lied to deliver on what you promise or loose potential users there is other apps like this one that they can use,0
love it ive been introduced to a lot of good material and found stuff i didnt think i would ever find,1
always has been a good app most every song ive ever looked for has been here,1
thank you for everything youve been a great help especially the music its great also there little problem that i have is when i starting with spotify in the playlist i used to have control on the mic to name the song on my play list i say what kind of music is playing on the mic used to capture it and it put it in my playlist i dont know if i have to pay extra for use this app or im doing something wrong,0
i love that i have access to all my favorite songs and pods but this app is waaay too glitchy sometimes it wont load a screen or play something even though every other app is functioning properly it will also randomly suggest podcasts that are totally unrelated to my interests but push a certain social narrative,0
looks like there are some real improvements now but still getting frozen and shuffle mode playing same songs,0
awesome app u will get any songs from this app which u will like,1
excellent music options reliable service,1
perfect app great stability and streaming i have been a premium member for a year and spotify does not disappoint -,1
spotify premium is awesome my number one choice for music streaming,1
fantastic music from top stars always available,1
super music app high quality misic,0
one of my favorite apps all the music i love and i can make as many playlists as i want any artist any song you can find it highly recommend to anyone who loves music,1
loved the app till this last update the app barely works now my music plays randomly stops when the screen goes off cant see what song your playing no listening bar on my lock screen clearly didnt do enough dev testing before the last update,0
all the music i can and want to listen to,1
fantastic app that understands that the right to free speech is more important than neil young bless your cotton socks spotify i love you,1
i love it cus this app contens a lot of international songs and it have storys too,1
the android version of the spotify app often encounters bugs that make it crash and has trouble with the currently playing area sometimes being inaccessible this is particularly annoying when you miss what someone said in a podcast and have to close the app and restart it before you can adjust your place,0
from my point of view this app is awesome well maintained ui dark theme variety of songs millions of playlist and more can try an awesome app for music soundtracks podcasts and more one thing which is missing is we cant download songs rest is fine,0
all my favourite music i can listen to in one place easy to make playlists never had any issues with spotify so far best way to discover new underrated music,1
i love how this works its smooth and i know i can count on it even when im off line ,1
great music easy to operate,1
one of the best music streaming apps out there,1
using spotify for years but got a new phone now when i click into the app it doesnt show any music or podcasts in any playlist literally everything wont work ,0
very good app we listen every artist songs,1
very pleased with spotify,1
you can only enjoy spotify with the subscription when you dont there are so many bad things the menus are more frustrating it constantly recommends songs and it switches to those recommended songs when you try to listen to your playlist,0
spotify playback no longer appears great app for finding new music but this simple issue is extremely fustrating i have to go on to my computer just to pause or scroll through a podcast if i want to skip a song i have to do the same would be good if this could be rectified,0
garbage app it will literally skip songs podcast randomly crashes randomly it will spontaneously open and start playing even after closing app very frustrating to use,0
everythings great till you hear sarcastic ads dont want sass from an app spotify theres enough of that in real life already ,1
love the variety of different music available,1
spotify went from songs not staying downloaded to becoming unresponsive and bricking my phone when it becomes stuck ,0
spotify what on earth happened to the shuffle button on mobile i can no longer shuffle my playlist like i could before i have premium so its not because of that and ive already reinstalled the app,0
i can only listen to two songs the i get lots of ads its more of an ad fest cant even enjoy listening to songs with how often you get ads and how many ads you get i get more ads than song its just horrible i used to get only one or two ads each time but it just keeps getting worse atleast have one or two ads at most five or more ads is just not it i listen to more ads than songs on spotify now its just infuriating when you have ads now just stop shoving a bunch of ads at our faces,0
its a good app dont get me wrongbut the thing is i try to pay and it doesnt acceptalso every other song without premium there is an adand also only 6skips per hourthats insanealso it add random songs to the playlistthese issues can all be fixed but for now yall have lost a installerrrrr ig but anyway i will not be using this app anymore till these simple things are fixedihave been using spotify for years now this has always been a problemspotify fix the patmentsthe amount of ads,0
wth 2 ads was tolerable but 5,0
absolutely love the wide selection of song choices,1
i love this app and its flexibility the search feature crashes the app on my old 2016 lg tablet unfortunately,0
love this app very happy with it but if you drop or censor joe rogan i will drop the app and go elsewhere,0
unable to install the new update- stops at 71,0
stop removing music also i have issues with this app and the desktop app litterally everyday and you keep giving obscene amounts of money to podcasters and for like a solid year the video playback was insufferable and still kind of is im incredibly sick of how bad spotify is absolutely awful ui 52622 they gave me a survey to fill out but i accidently pressed the back key and its just gone now i wouldve liked tove done it having issues with local files now 531 desktop app wont launch,0
good app,1
excellent app with a huge selection of music from a broad range of genres,1
still a bit glitchy but working much better great app,1
this app is extremely awesome i love it it is so easy to play what you want when you want to highly recommend,1
spotify gets me up and going love my music memories experiences,1
cant get reception occasionally the music will ply the first tune but will stop in the second tunewill play again on pressing any button plz help,0
takes a very long time for the playlists tab and the podcasts tab to load sometimes it never loads,0
my stress reliever my addiction to be honest this is my true love at the end ill be like  it started in 2019 and now its 2050 am 45 and my love is yet not gone for you spotify   the way app is designed is comfortable for me to access the color gives me some kind of warm feel and lot more good things to state my only problem is ads,1
the best app to listen to your songs,1
playback controls disappear on android cant pause a song have to turn off app to pause a song yes really really basic thing that ruins the experience and frustrating enough to cancel premium membership if this is the service we get this error has been submitted numerous times in last weeks and still has not been fixed dont install or get a membership until this is fixed or you will regret it,0
so many ads and cant even play the song i want it always start shuffling songs,0
very well implemented app and easy to use,1
too political i dont want the politics just the music drop the politics spotify i thought i was buying a music service not a political platform sheesh,0
not playing when phone screen goes off and not showing whats playing so cant stop playback or like the song,1
your app performance has fallen apart in the last few weeks regularly it forces me into offline mode now and doesnt have my full downloaded library despite being connected to working wifi regularly it fails mid song as well now sharing music is also not working across the board now previously everything worked and now it doesnt work well,0
it was all good till i purchased my airpods it started slowing down pausing in between with no reason but before that it was goodand the airpods are not the issue,0
cant open the app suddenly i tried uninstalling it but its the same after reinstalling again im stuck at the logo,0
ok music app but the music is not very loud lacks punch i have to have my phones volume up nearly full needs some sort of volume booster built in like vradio player and the app now is full of ads which makes it basically unusable,0
downloaded spotify after barcelona deal was confirmed now i understand they referred you as agiant company imsuperb its simply the best ever,1
i love the way spotify shuffles the music but they should let us choose the that we want to play n let us listen offline without paying for premium,0
too many ads,0
great app so far at least couple of hours daily,1
if i could give them a negative five i would i tried to cancel the premium service before the subscription was up and they still charge me after i hadnt used it for a whole week after subscription was over when i talk to chat they told me that they closed my account but then my account was charged a second time and i still have premium service that i do not want and im paying for and i do not use it,0
i love spotify and all but recently whenever i want to add songs to a playlist im unable to preview it anymore please fix this bug if its now a premium thing i didnt know,0
i love this app im a huge fan of true crime podcasts and spotify delivers them thank you spotify,1
i have yet to look for an artist or a song that they dont have wonderful free music app,0
giving 4 start bcoz i didnt found all the songs which i wanted but overall best app for songs and clearity of the songs is awesome premium membership is too good,1
very very good experience but since last fews days i am facing 1 prob when i play anything theres no bar or screen which shows play puase forward  backwrd doesnt show up while playing i have to restart to get that plz resolve this asap,0
experience has been awful lately the fwdback 10 secs and pause options are missing half the time podcasts stop playing for no reason have updated 3 times with no improvement,0
decent app other than getting potentially 5 ads every few songs,0
the reduce star is just because i cant see the lyric together with the song i truly like how diverse the choices of songs are,1
 amazing its just the ads that bother me other than that its really good,1
problems on my tablet wont stop playing the stop start menu does not appear or does not match what us playing,0
almost useless in free mode you cant play any song you actually want only playlists of other songs you didnt want to listen to and you had to watch a 30 second ad for the pleasure of not hearing the song you want ui makes everything more difficult too,0
love the personalization of the playlists,1
amazing app but too much of advertising intrupsion,0
recent bugs make it unusable maybe use some of the money you dont pay artists to fix the app,0
thanks for the 15 minutes of ad free music,1
shocking wont play for more than a few seconds keeps crashing and cannot see the whats playing bar anymore trying to update and just get the spinning wheel of doom im taking my money elsewhere ,0
changed my music experience positively,1
was hesitant on getting it tried the free trial a couple years ago love it,1
i only today downloaded this app and started using it yet im already so in love with it its not was i thought it was its so much better i just dont c myself living without it im so addicted i love it,1
im actually giving like 49 stars just because i cant select multiple songs at once,0
to expensive to buggy doesnt have certain artists going to go find a more inclusive less expensive app,0
took it down to 4 stars cause you cant turn off shuffle anymore  edit nevermind they just moved ityou have to go to the three dots in the upper right corner after you go to the current song,0
most coolest app ever u just need some money for downloading music which is really insane u can download any song its really,1
spotify keeps randomly pausing my music and it keeps asking i want to allow bluetooth control every time i open my phone this is really annoying im so close to canceling my subscription and moving to apple music,0
dude theres an add every 2 songs look i know you want to make money but dude its way too much adds every 2 songs theres like 3 adds stfu dude its so annoying,0
constant issues love the music but get it together i cant see the song that playing or pause it have to restart from the beginning every time ridiculous,0
it doesnt matter if i click allow or maybe later - every single time i navigate to the app it asks me whether i will allow it to connect to bluetooth and it is driving me crazy just stop it,0
i have a paid subscription and use this app all the time since the latest update the app is useless the control bar disappears so tracks cant be paused or skipped songs randomly stop playing and even the recommended songs have no relation to the playlist roll back whatever mess youve made and start again,0
it is very very nice  nice,1
great music app like it that new improvements come from time to time just want lyrics for all the songs i like,1
spotify free is quite scummy honestly a playlist is pretty much the same as daily mix at th is point they play a few songs from the playlist then start going down a rabbit hole of associated radios and its really annoying after some time or when they finally finish giving you all the songs from the playlist they just change lanes and you dont hear another one of your preferred songs until you reset the app and click the playlist again and more doesnt work which just really sucks,0
very good apppremium member for about three years or so never had any problems still alot of bandssongs and albums that are not available i can go on and on overall four stars,1
i really like spotify i can play all my favorite songs in shuffle while my phone off i have spotify premium and i think it makes the expirence better but its still enjoyable without premium its easy to use and i recommend it to anyone who loves or likes playing the songs they like,1
great place to listening music,1
im really enjoying spotify,1
you can access all music that you like,1
it is great you get almost free skips i defintetly recomend this app,0
its so good at morning i wake up goodly and i am sooooo ready to start it like am always grumpy but with spotify i feel good,1
really nice app  but sometimes it creates a little problem  after playing the playlist sometimes it stops and again i have to play the playlist ,0
perfect place to find music,1
everything about this app is amazing except for not being able to play the exact song you want to play unless you signed up for something or only have 6 skips per hour but other than that its an amazing app i recommend it,1
chandwaliya song is a hectic manstop its advertisement hearing it for the thousand time is as hell,0
too much ads i dont wanna pay premium have a decent amount of songs here though,0
so my spotify doesnt want to play my music and its downloaded but when i click on it silence,0
it amazes me that an app like this can have four stars why do i have to connect online after i download an episode why do i have to use data to see in episode that ive already downloaded that seems to me like a bunch of bs so im like you know this sucks is somebody that only has two gigs of data per month im just starting to hate the internet sooner or later youll be gone and youll be forgotten and nobody will remember you but i dont remember the hate for your data usage,0
thanks for providing so many ads here i frequently come here to listen to those ads i just love it ,1
suddenly have a new banner at the top of the app that says your preview is currently active  the only google result i can find has been removed by spotify doesnt seem half dodgy  care to explain what its all about dont trust things i dont know about that suddenly appear especially when the only thing i can find about it has been deleted by you ive ceased using your app immediately and am now using youtube until you can explain whats up,0
my experience was great until i knew that i cannt forward and backward the songs  and the ads was irritating  i love this app,1
it is everything i could want in a music app it has all my favorites and finds me new music to love i dont think i could live without spotify it is truly the soundtrack of my life,1
the connect bluetooth notification every time i open the app is mad annoying and they changed the library to include random radio playlists i listened to like 1 time instead of my actual music app used to be good but all these bad unnecessary updates ruin it,0
best app ever  i love how that now i pretty much depend my life on it but it would have been better if there was no internet connection you would still play your liked songs but out of all love it ,1
this app is very easy to use and recommends you music that youve been listening recently the spotify premium is affordable too and i havent encountered any major bugs i also like the update since they added podcast so that we can have fun or listen to stories of other people while it is playing in the background actually when i first installed this i got confused cuz it only allows 5 skips then i saw that i need premium so i bought it i actually thought it is more expensive but its not,0
feel fine,1
not fit for purpose im guessing if you pay its fine cant select what so ga you want to listen to its always on shuffle a lot of the time you select an album and it plays songs from an unrelated playlist the same advert every few songs at least mix it up choose from your favourites list and it only plays a sample,0
best app for songs and the most thing i loved in spotify is its ui its is very easy and so nice  but the only one negative is its playing often the ads if we play one song also it will play first ads and next only it will play the song and after two songs played it will ads again spotify please reduce ur ads,0
the app is so useful you can listen to the songs while doing anything n everything songs makes emotions more valuable but i think they should decrease the rate of ads a little bit thats why i am giving it 4 for now but it will be set to 5 when the ad rate is deacresed the song quality is so good thats why i will recommend to use this app for sure,0
actually this app deserves 5 stars but i give it 4 coz there are some music which are unplayable dont know whats the reason behind it but its a kind request to avail them asap,0
used it for the first time today after the update put my ear pods in to take dog for walk it just keeps pausing for no reason i have to take my phone out and press play on my phone really irritating never had issue with this before update please sort it out,0
yk when you dont have a credit card and you want premium and you want to pay by paysafe just in case add payment by paysafebut the app is great,1
the app experience in not up to the mark animations are not smooth  the app always maintain a dark mode which is not acceptable,0
the app is really good but i hate how how you have to shuffle to listen to playlist and not just pick a song you want to listen to and how many ads there are i get 9-10 ads before i can listen to a song or the song just gets skipped cause of internet connections even though im connected to strong internet some times i hate how you need to pay for a offline playlist spotify is a really good app but even though it has some pros it has a lot more down sides to it,0
wont display the song and doesnt give me the option to change song since this latest updateall my liked trackes disappeared all but a handfulit lags and al lot of my saved music never appears to be there when i have no servicei feel like this app has become worse over the years ive tried redownloading it and it hasnt helped the situation,0
i have to cancel or at least change my payment method for spotify but i canf do it through the app and the website automatically redirects me to the app i now have a -54 balance due to overdraft fees and i cant pay that,0
i love the extensive music options,1
to be honest paying for an app is not ideal even on premium it stops playing and you have to log in and start again not wow,0
i cont find defferent -defferent language songs on this app,0
i have a paid account as i prefer having my own playlists recommendations are usually good ive found a few real gems,1
spotify is a digital music podcast and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world basic functions such as playing music are totally free but you can also choose to upgrade to spotify premium  build collections of music and podcasts and more spotify is an excellent streaming music service that wins pcmag editors choice award,1
not low enough let me listen to my own playlist stop adding songs and even songs that arent on there just stop and if i click on one song let me listen to that song stop playing songs that are similar,0
needs to have a night mode or incognito mode because my sleep music messes up my wrap at the end of the year,0
enjoy the next 30 minutes free from advertising songadadadadsongadadsongsongad i was a pior premium user but due to excessive bugs and podcast issues have chosen to discontinue paying for a premium account and will probably find a alternative service,0
app good ads too bad one or 3 songs after 3 advertised hate this but love app songs,1
its spotify its great that is all,1
good selection of music,1
great app for music and podcasts,1
good music non-stop playlists no ads for premium hence gives you the best feeling when low truly music is medicine,1
best music library ever i love it,1
since music selection has little range ittle do,0
love the app it works perfectly i am so thankful to have this app,1
too much ads i got 3 ads in a row and 2 of them were the same thing,0
something is wrong with spotify its not letting me repeat songs and its not showing the songs hope u can fix it and i will give this 5 stars again,0
from my experience with music apps this is definitely the clear winner keep up the good work guys john x,1
i cant play my playlist without playing a raido with songs ive never heard before,1
i found that spotify used 98 of my battery life since last full charge the problem is that usage was 100 background usage on top of that if you try to limit background usage the app will shut down suddenly or fail to start the next song after one finishes spotify for mobilegoodbye pandora here i come,0
i love this app i always list6 to music bit this new update is horrible i went on spotify and i do not know how do play songs im really upset,0
worst app even after buying paid subscription i can never play music offline and playlists keep downloading again and even after countless times of re-download one can not play offline music,0
this app could be better for example it isnt exactly clear on things i dont understand how to close a song and play another one and i dont understand why i cant just play my list in the order its in also i keep getting random songs in my lists and i dont know how to stop them the app is overall just not clear on how to do some things and it just gets annoying,0
an update of the app took it all away will uninstall,0
allows the spread of misinformation i guess it is really just another entertainment platform like fox news,0
nice,1
honestly great app algorithm needs some work tho songs i have put in dont play again still show up in my daily mixes why i clearly dont to hear them so why still have them there just curious other than that great app,0
minus the occasional ads the app is perfect providing music playlist and podcasts by some youtubers,1
nice app best for music  but i want to buy premium but it is not on redeem code thats why i cant buy it plz make it on redeem code also,0
i love having all my fave music right there within a click,1
thing i hate in old spotify im premium but my storage is full and i delete then i uninstall apps and i down load now but i cant restore purchase please fix it,0
should stop adding songs to the playlist without authors permission some songs irrelevant should ask every time before adding songs automatically,0
very difficult to update paymenteverytime i choose my operator it always unable to connect very dissapointed,0
thank you spotify for supporting free speech and expression every single person in the world has a right to voice there music or opinion,1
love it easy to usegreat selection of songs,1
sound and beat quality of songs are very good,1
was 5 star but recently the quality of its functionality is terrible the app is not working properly playpause forward buttons not showing when playing from liked songs and controls dont appear when screen is locked music still playing when app is closed  what is going on,0
i hate this update and why did you unabled all my playlist i cant even listen to whatever music that i wanted adds keeps popping up stop focusing on money this ruined it,0
please make it available for through prepaid payment so that easier for those who dont have credit card especially student like me over all its super good and working just fine for me,1
doesnt randomize when shuffled plays the same 10 artists in my playlists over and over despite 3000 songs and over 50 arists in my playlist reinstall doesnt fix this issue despite response from spotify support,0
good but too many ads,0
music plays but the whole music playing screen is missing and its stuck in the home screen to make the problem go away the app needs to be restarted,0
spotify is fine except when ur a free listener it gives u limited skips adds random songs to your playlist gives u ad after ad after ad and it just ruins the whole app i will no longer be using spotify,0
very easy to find songs and to download,1
best music streaming app ever ,1
got some troubles with synching app on pc and phone update play bar keeps disappearing app crashes but no updates are available really annoying situation,0
worst app for songs  there are lots of ads and then suddenly no songs will play it will stop playing songs until you buy premium membership,0
nvm free spotify sucks,0
i like the old classic songs is very easy to get it,1
so best this app can search what we want song and can do listen song with do homework,1
used to be great by now however there seems to be a probability feature behind everything starting with simply pressing the play button will it work and when will my offline playlist still be there when i need it i gave it some time to review maybe it was my old phone and internet situation but after changing both nope still buggy after months if you are just starting and dont have sunk cost in playlists collections do yourself a favour and check out the competitors,0
the app was good but lately i have been having issues as i am seeing no internet connection available but my internet is working fine as i am able to play songs but not able to search for any new song or the song i want to listen to i am able to play only the created playlist please do help me if you can,1
being premium user i felt this is the best music app  i tried all other music streaming apps with their premium like ressoganna apple music wynk music jiosavanetcbut this app is something else  next level quality of music and its algorithm works so perfect that you will get 910 out of the random songs of your tastebut you will get real-premium service of this app only if you are a premium user recommended for paid users,1
i would give it 5 stars if it doesnt containt the shuffle mode that you cant turn off and also the adds that tells you how it will b good if you get spotify premium so i hope you really delete these things that bind you,1
nice one,1
not working properly cant hear a preview when adding songs to any playlist and play bar disappears ,0
you only unscribe or cancel the package at webnot at the apppooryou should add to app so it would be easier to subscribe or cancel the package,0
good,1
cant really use cuz cant play songs that i like because it add songs for you deing able to download 1-2 songs for freelight mode but like im gonna use it and make it easyer to find settings mobile,0
last update killed it so buggy and crashes almost every time please fix the issues,0
spotify is one of the best streaming apps every time i look up a song spotify has it and you can also listen to varieties of podcasts,1
except for the ads which are childish best music app,0
i was pretty unsure about getting this app but im a fan after exploring it for a while it is a bit disappointing that most songs i search for are not available but maybe one day theyre be added,0
very nice experience ,1
like another reviewer has said lately spotify has not been working well the function to pause or stop whats playing disappears and the only thing i can do is uninstall the app to stop whats playing very annoying,0
i like this app,1
love using spotify i get all the music i love n i be vibing all day the only thing i dont think i like is once am out of internet i cant use the app,0
latest update broke it entirely plays on phone plays on computer even lets google connect to it but decided to no longer connect to my car now i have to go to the generic bluetooth audio setting and it sounds worse and has less controls,0
i have been using spotify from last 1 year the sound quality is top notch i can feel the music i would definitely recommend spotify to my friends thanks so much spotify team for providing a best product,1
disappearing controls are making this app unusable it also ignores my setting to not resume playing automatically i never want this-- who does ive been waiting for over a year for these to be fixed and nothing another android dev team failing to bother testing their own app,0
spotify is the best music app in the world i love it it has all the music i could ever dream of keep it up,1
ily spotify,1
my go to place for my fave tracks,1
how are u the worst and the only 1 thats goodish i cant stand how everything that a normal streaming app should have is behind a pay wall how come i cant just get the song i want i have too go in to a trash playlist just too find the song and sometimes its the 2nd or 3rd song in the playlist if your lucky it could be soooos far in the playlist your the effin eadice of music streaming like goddam i cant just find a song from a creator to my knowledge im just mad u shouldnt acknowledg,0
there should be an option for play next and it would also be nice if the theme could be customised,0
gud why is it soo big for a music player tho,0
whats going on with this app freezing crashing ask joe rogan for a few millions to fix your broken a app just wondering why it never crashes or freezes when you take our money,0
best music app by far i also use shazam and waze which intwine with spotify not complex and easy to use well organized interface,0
what happen to the canvas i cant skip to next songs both on phone and bluetooth cannot select loop random or direct cant see the lyrics and cant skip through songs please fix this,0
looks like they deleted my review or something i hate it when its like play random song on my playlist and i cant skip it to forward or backward thats 2 fix it and ill change my mind i mean all of the user change theyre mind,0
great music library but the app is horrible more often than not it fails to play downloaded music without wifi making it useless for commuting,0
where did the shuffle button go it just disappeared also theres literally no way to rearrange songs in a play listen,0
its very good but i hate the fact that i can only shuffle like i cant choose the song i can listen to anymore unless thats a premium thing also the music downloads dont even work for offline,0
good app,1
i cant skip musics cant choose music of my choice  damn you go too far just for not subscribing,1
spotify is great for listening to all sorts of music my only problem is that it cost 10 dollars a month for premium,1
always been pushy with ads and their ever increasing costs newest update butchered its ability to cast to any of my google home devices getting tired of paying more for ever decreasing quality of product,0
i like new music and the old music and all other music different backgrounds thanks,1
perfection would be nice to see like a shazam feature in future updates still dope a featurevto dm people with similar music taste would be ,0
very good one of the best music experience i have had,1
god this app is so annoying  the ads are so annoying and i only get five skips spotify sucks i dont want your stupid premium bull,0
ive had spotify for many years now  have tried many other music apps but always come back to spotify,1
the app is constantly updated yet still has the same bugs it doesnt work right on my lg g8 or samsung s22,0
great music old and new i can always find what i am looking for,1
awesome music but way too much ads,0
my experience has been phenomenal i no longer have to search for songs i like the free trial was amazing to i was encouraged to go for premium at only 3 99 dollars  per month,1
it is a good platform for music when u get premium and higher quality sound,1
awesome  amazing experiencelove the app,1
more and more it just stops working and i cant look up any more music without force stopping the app in addition you cant auto organise your library when using a desktop app which is a baffling omission in an app designed to look up music and save playlists the app has continued to get worse incredibly suddenly the bar showing you the track currently playing just sort of gets bored and disappears want to stop the music time to force stop the app the again how do spotify get away with it,0
amazing how it knows my favorite songs loving it,1
wont let me pay for premium when i enter my payment info and tap the button nothing happens lame,0
very happy thanks a very good range of fantastic music kind regards from ollie from freezing frankston 3199 victoria lol,1
unbelievably the best lost of words really,1
good appsecondly used no lyrics w songs and my playlist wont open up,0
a few adds but its really nice you can listen to any song i can play songs even when the network is very slow although it takes some time to load but then it works just smooth,1
was bad for awhile finally reintroduced widget and local file support now if we could finally get lossless formats i can understand bandwidth being an excuse but now im getting tictoks streamed to my phone so the bandwidth budget must not be an issue or would it cost them more i dont see why i cant get flac or why that should cost me more just remove the video and give me better sound its literally the whole point of this app,0
this is my favourite music app by a long shot and i can stream almost any song that i want to,1
im givin this 3 stars because on the moblie version the option to repeat one song and choosing what song you want to hear on all playlists have been removed and there are way to many ads if you get the chance please have an update where we can freely repeat and choose any song we want instead of paying for premium,0
algorithm is lovely except the endless harvest moon covers pls stop,1
i can only get the preview of the songs i mean its not even the full songs,0
who svet thought about limiting people so much stop playing me recommended stop i guess its a great platform for creators but you are just vicked,0
my family uses the application we love the application but my doesnt work that well and i downloaded all my songs when i try to play my songs offline it doesnt work i dont know if its because my table be old,0
so frustrated with spotify at the moment since the latest update to android my spotify automatically shuts down when android goes into rest or locked mode the only way i can keep it running is to use google maps to keep the android screen on or just keep the screen active in another way my father is experiencing the same issue on a completely different android phone please fix this issue as it has been happening for months now,0
easy to use and provides great suggestions,1
beautiful and so gifted thank you for your music,1
well done every songs avalible you can listen to any song that is not avalible in gaana like moonlight made by dhruv so thats it and you know like sigma male beats are also are avalible and there are beats avalible so i also personally recommend you or you can say that publicly recommend you that  download this app now and listen to podcast that are not avalible in gaana ok  bye because i like this app so much to describe i shared   my own experience,1
all of you that are complaining about skips and ads need to buy the subscription lmao  stop being cheap  greatest music app yet,0
i used spotify premium since one month without any hassles but experiance that songs on playlists stop after 2 songs that is very annoying having guests over for dinner and music stops all the time very poor it is time to move on and to sign up with another music download platform - deezer,0
i primarily listen to podcast and theres such a wide variety i love it,1
i like spotify i listened to my 1st norwegian podcast girl in red ,1
recently wont show me what im currently listening to and randomly stops playing songs on spotify premium,0
whats going on my music keeps cutting all of a sudden  fix please and thank you  i dont like paying for bs,0
i swear its too restricting spotify was a lot better before the update,0
i love this one too much more than the other apps,1
in general great love the personalised playlists and it usually works only thing that annoys me is sometimes when i open it it buffers for ages and i dont understand why,0
love this app easy listening has a lot of music and podcast anything its great,1
i like spotify  well its a great musik streaming app yet it anoys me so much that it bugs so bad like i cant even listen too songs too add too my playlist anymore at all and it just stops and i cant turn of musik normaly,0
it dont never put on the songs that i asked for to put on thats annoying,1
the app sometimes plays the wrong songs when i try to listen to my playlists and it goes on for a while,0
current app version has all logged me out for no reason over 5 times then i try to login but it does not allow me to login because i had the app set to offline i like playing my music offline as a spotify premium user the only way to fix this is by deleting all app data and then logging in from scratch then it removes all of my downloaeded songs over 3500 it also has consistently greyed out certain songs that i have downloaded time and time again i am close to canceling,0
good,1
i really enjoy this app  its great listening to so many different genre ,1
it is nice all of best songs are there it is recommendable to other people,1
3rd class appp ,1
great music app sucks closes all the time makes you start podcast from the beginning freezes up often super liberal as well so some things you search for arent available,0
love,1
this is better then amazon music i love it i keeps me up with new songs pretty sure they dont have all of these on it but i hate the advertisements,1
ive been using the premium subscription for years ive never had issues with the apps and generally find their updates to be intuitive i live in south korea and while some older songs are still romanized most have the lyrics in korean it is frustrating that you cant change the language settings in the app it follows the language your phone is in but to me the music quality quantity and download options make up for it overall a nice service thats worth the price,1
i subscribe so dont have any issue with ads and its well worth it most tracks are on spotify and only a rare few arent available due to copyright i have a large collection of cds and rarely play them i can control what i listen to from my phone play an entire album 1 track one of my playlists or programme a queue off the top of my head i would recommend spotify without hesitation,1
i love spotify to death but the new lyrics feature will not work and its forgetting on my nerves spotify fix yourself,0
not worth the download waste of my internet data whats wrong with this app i just dont understand why this app is not playing any songs i cant hear the audio also when the search result shows its not allowing me to click on the song another one is that its not showing my account name correct very trashy app i uninstalled it quickly,0
samsung s10 trying to get premium and it keeps logging me out and saying not available oops try again,0
app is so buggy now its time to cancel my premium family plan what good is it when it randomly stops plays wrong songs takes forever to load and half the time the controls arent displayed,0
spotify is so good and famous that i dont have to write anything everybody know how awesome this app is ,1
im sorry but spotify is starting to really make pointless changes to the app and isnt even giving an alternative choice for the consumer once they change the place of buttons super annoying,0
excellent music recommendations,1
its good,1
nice work spotify,1
absolutely love spotify  the fact you can get everything from music to podcasts all in one place its fantastic,1
it is been terrible for the past couple of weeks i can not access the app when my network data is on and data is actively working i have used different network data but still have the same problem it is really frustrating fix it thanks,0
spotify is great but hasnt been loading latey i will try to reinstall,0
its the best music app i have had you can get any album song podcasts unless you have to pay for it but other than that it great,1
new update causing app to crash whenever a song starts playing,0
i have heard the same song 5x an hour every hour if not more listening to music at work using the premium trial i can see some repeating songs listening for 8hrs but that is ridiculous plus after im already angry and wanting to cancel my subscription i cant even do it through the app,0
i would give 25 stars if i could the app is great when it works some updates are great while others render the app unusable i want to give 5 stars but the inconsistencies are brutal,0
this app has very poor conditions like lots of ads coming after every song and this app also shows to take premium and we cant listen the songs offline and some songs like sar jo tera chakrey has very poor sound quality,0
originally when free  it was good service bought myself a subscription for christmas and was blown away by the service now its april and im ok with it as it no longer plays on my phone when the screen locks  same thing thats made me drop youtube music still would recommend the service for the amazing selection of music,1
old version is good,1
i love the app if a 90 day trial period with premium were available i could really love it after experiencing it full on its a great app though,1
whenever i try to update payment they wont let me now i couldnt play on premium,0
love love having all genres of music and endless play lists at hand,1
ive been using this app for 3 years now never had many problems on spotify but its been a month since it started to be glitchy 1every time i turn off my phone screen the music stops and my speaker starts making glitchy noises and to make it work again i gotta turn on my screen and leave it like that while the music plays 2when i play my playlist there are always those 56 songs on loop and thats really frustrating 3the song stops and the timing bar keeps going cant fix that lol,0
bad app theres better options available hard to navigate menus you have to pay money if you want to skip songs in playlists theres no option to just listen to a song you have to listen to through a entire playlist its just bad not worth the download,0
playlist that are download suddenly have the majority of songs not downloaded i cant download them because it says they are but wont play offline and says they arent downloaded please fix so i can listen to the music that im paying for,0
ads are annoying but other than that its fine,1
does exactly what i want it to do are you coming out with a higher bit rate higher definition version soon thanks in advance,1
good,1
would be 5 starts but lately has been very buggy and not functioning properly music stops randomly or doesnt show whats currently playing sometimes settings act up been disconnected when connected to other devices,0
moving on up with the top tunes and podcasts thx ezemixilogistmmm,1
need to fix the stupid app its so annoying to have to listen to 3 ads then only get to listen to 2 songs before u get more ads,0
spotify itself is great but i thought i should say on multiple occasions ive had to watch up to 6 add in a row and songs i remove from my playlist always show up especially when i am out of skipsbut all around cool app edit my free trial for spotify premium ended like a week early not cool,0
so many bugs on oneplus 8t the bar is not showing at the bottom,0
i dont like how i can only shuffle play which is really annoying since my playlist gets messed up every time i play it but the addition of random songs to my playlist is even worse so now instead of spotify i use youtube for my music,0
all the poor people are giving 1 star as they can t afford premium they dont know that all music have ad if u pay it goes away spotify congo i have your premium on ios device and it is the best decision i made,1
i already wrote a review idk where it went but im so frustrated rn bc the app keeps skipping songs about 30 seconds in idk if this is a stupid setting i have enabled but spotify is unusable like this it randomly plays things starts over songs skips songs and just jumps to random parts of a song so frustrated edit i think i got hacked from connecting my spotify to other apps logged out of all devices and denied permissions and it seems to be fixed,0
wow man this app is more better than gaana we can not only hear songs we can also hear podacasts i love this app literlly well done developers keep it up ,1
i thought spotify would be a great music app until i actually installed it i decided to make a playlist and after 3 songs that i added myself a random song that wasnt my taste just started playing also when i searched up a song and clicked on it the song itself didnt play i had to skip 7 times to get to it,0
its randomly annoying if i try to press the song thats currently playing to open up the song screen then it presses the song behind it also if i unlike a song itll stay with a heart and wont let me save it i even after restarting the app so i had to uninstall the app,0
hey the app is pretty good but there are no lyrics coming on my account please check this issue,0
magnetic,1
absolutely love it 100 out of 100,1
it was a good app then it was just bad cause when u play a playlist u cant pick the song u want to listen to nomore and now it play random songs,0
ive had spotify for 2 years now but im uninstalling after they decided to remove neil youngs music instead of removing covid misinformation i guess ill just settle with youtube music now ,0
great app to listen to your favourite music,1
easy to use best in sound low data usage low battery consumption ,0
the ease price point and quality of the streaming service make this an excellent music application a radio edit section or censored section would make it even easier to operate,1
ill never spay for sporify so long as they support joe rogans misinformation or take money from kroger who chose closing stores over paying pandemic hazard pay,0
its good but the shuffling needs to stop i cant play one single song alone this is why i uninstalled it earlier,0
the worst glitchiest app ive ever used slow cuts out freezes when you skip brand new samsung so not my phone useless,0
this is literally the best way to listen to music as long as your willing to pay for premium and would actually use it enough for it to be useful that being said ive been using it for 7 years and been paying for premium off and on for about 5 and this is 2022,1
this is best app for music friends aap isme apni plalist bena sekte hai or yeh playlist ke tipe ke songs aapko suggest kerega thank you for your app,1
never works properly unable to pause or even let a songpodcast play have had issues and developers get back to me with no working solution have to update every 2 days they wont even offer me a discount this is why monopolies are illegal samsung z flip 3 stuck with them i guess,0
i like this but whenever i play ofline games it just stops  please fix spotify,0
bad appsvery complicated to re-subscribe monthly payment and always error,0
i have premium so i dont have ads but i definitely love this app,1
best music app i have downloaded everi am surprised why i didnt get it before ,1
when i search for a specific song it plays something else eg i search and play sunday best and instead of sunday best it plays something different this app is very difficult to use and instead of raising vibes it raises stress i dont recommend this app as a medium for music,0
this is my life,1
i download this app because of girls generation and its good but its so many ads,1
latest update broke the app when i reopen the app from suspended background state says nothing is playing and is not connected to bluetooth but last song is playing on bluetooth have to exit app and restart and it forgets what playlistqueue was loaded fix it,0
i can get all the songs i want to listen to except i hate love by toni braxton tidal has better sound but consumes more data hifi or not i like how spotifys data saver is always on and i barely use any data,0
its really awsome where i can listen to my heartbroken songs,0
its easily the best streaming platform out of all of them only issue is of recent it has been crashing more and i have to re-download my library thats the only reason its not getting 5 stars,0
i like the 2 songs i downloaded but if you cave to socialismcommunism im out,0
app keeps turning off since the last update,0
very entertaining and informative all in one app enjoying it ,1
i absolutely love it,1
went with pandora instead smfh the ads are so bad at least pandora shows the ad on the screen instead of playing it over your music i uninstalled because they wouldnt let me skip a song after i disliked it i had to listen to the song so yeah nope pandora doesnt do that,0
app is showing no internet connection aftwr android 12 update when connected on mobile network,0
nice app working nicely,1
latest update made app terrible on mobile the song that is playing is not being displayed in the widgets nor in the app nor in the top slider of the phone app keeps losing connection and randomly cuts out and picks back up after a few seconds really makes me reconsider my 999 monthly subscription if i can barely listen to my music,0
cant stop playing now lost the on sceen controls for playing pausing etc have to restart phone to get it to stop,0
the latest update broke the app now the music player controls play pause fast-forward etc are gone i have to shutdown and restart the app to get the controls again but they eventually disappear again please fix,0
it is perfect app because i got every song i want but in ganna i dont use to get,0
best overall music app very easy to access everything and has an impressive collection of artists and songs also being a premium subscriber the offline mode is definitely worth it the whole subscription gives you an amazing selection of features barely comparable to any other platform,1
compared to the desktop version the mobile app is really terrible its lacking important features that the desktop version already has one of those missing features is the ability to reorder the songs in your playlists and with the new update you have to push the and more button to see all the songs in it and when you do that and click on one of the songs it doesnt play the whole song just the short preview of it make the trashy mobile app function more like the desktop version,0
functional premium is worth the cost,1
i enjoy spotify when i have to take a huge lunge of disasterous tenacity at my commitment to societal pressures,0
edited on 21st april 2022 the premium service audio quality seems bit dull compared to telegram audio quality hope they fix it and rest i cant get over of spotify,0
simple to use rich content diverse authors,1
with this app i can galau,1
the best music streaming platform even though i dont have premium still the quality is at its best,1
i have found it easy to use and really good when i am riding my excercise bike and listening to the music  i do 10 miles every morning before breakfast  i am an 80 year old who has always loved cycling but not on the road anymore  thank you for the app ,1
 nice app,1
so far i have not had any problems looking up my kind of music i love it i like you music thats classic it was easy,1
i noticed when people spend money on something they want too much for their money and still arent satisfied i was once a person who thought he could live without spotify because pandora was available i was wrong spotify is like having bonds  nobles in your phone tablet or computer i being a music person thats a person who goes to sleep with music and music wakes me daily cant live without it so you do you just dont cheat yourself if you cant buy all the latest music,0
hate the ads but i will always hate ads so no hard feelings,1
why does spotify deletes all my downloaded songs daily whats the use of buying premium then i have to download songs everyday and see it been get deleated the next day fix it asap,0
music randomly stops playing since recent updates,0
cant turn off shuffle,1
not as great as apple music but yeah better than other music streaming apps,1
this new update is going to make me change to another streaming service cant press play or skip any songs pauses music for minutes at a time without being able to do anything about it,0
this update sucks i cant replay the music like before i used to like spotify but cause of this stupid update now i dont really like it,0
i am not able to cancel my subscription plan its displaying something went wrong,1
u should need to show only one ad at a time but the no of ads is 2 ,0
i got to enjoy my fave songs instantly,1
great music but difficult to access help when trying to change plan,0
nicee,1
good great but only if there was the equalizer like in apple so i can change the sound more efficiently but still good took me 2 years but i found the equalizer haha so 5 for me,1
i love spotify definitely my favorite especially premium so awesome thank you guys for doing such a great job,1
i have been using spotify for many years it is an amazing music player i have ever seen,1
spotify has become trash within the last 6 months please make it good again,1
superb music app,1
this app was good but now its very irritating because of too much adsyou have to face 2 ads in order to listen 1 song which is very irritating second issue is this app has now become little laggy,0
app is extremely buggy and frustrating even downloading episodes results in poor playback constant crashes and freezing,0
when i want play a song i find a different song playing,0
streaming to desktop is a wonderful feature as i use it to play music when in vr music selection is great and the precurated playlist are filled with awesome tunes 105,1
enjoying the music very little to no interruptions great mix of music as well,1
ive been paying 1599 for the premium package for years and before that i was on the same package except it was only i believe 1299 when i started and i have to uninstall and reinstall and re-download all of my 73 plus playlist which takes over 3 hours to download all of on a regular basis the audio either doesnt play for it or the playlist sailor downloaded but when you open them up they wont play a thousand different things i do not recommend paying for this app get youtube but not this,0
i love spotify but its sometimes difficult to find a song and sometimes it gets bugged id love that you let us download the lyrics from the each song we want thats how we could sing our songs without internet,0
there is no better music streaming service,0
i have the latest version and on premium but dont have the lyrics on the app ,0
i pay for premium and it works great unlimited skips i can play any song at any time and there are mostly no adds for some reason i still have two or more adds in my podcasts which are 30-45 minutes not sure if im doing something wrong but it doesnt seem fair that i pay for no adds and yet there are a surplus of them in every podcast episode,0
it has deleted all playlists including any playlist i click on the web cant play anything uninstalled the up for good after using it for 5-6 years,0
after the latest update the app is keep crashing,0
just needs the swipe left option on a song like i phones to queue a song and it will be the best but because it doesnt 4 stars,0
whenever i add songs to my playlist i always hear other songs thats not in my playlist at all like song that im completely unfamiliar with,0
awesome product for listening but i am experiencing some bugs,0
just recently been using a spotify premium trial and i cant even use it without the app force closing itself when im using another app fix it,0
so far no complaints but so artists tracks are missing,0
this app is so bad i been reinstall it more than 9 time but my music is still not playing it only show me to choose my music taste and only playing adds not the music,0
good app for songs,1
its basically freedom at its finest if you already have spotify for your pc or tv then get the app too to easily keep learning,1
very good,1
cant login from fb account after last update,0
huge database easy to use interface value for money,0
of course i like this but ads its literally too much you say i can hear music 30 minutes after one ad but i am hearing ad after listening 2-3 songs and its so irritating please do something about this,0
refusing to recognize play lists now using browser version until fixed ,0
good service,1
incredibly varied entertainment for all,1
i tried to played other device but on my device it always got crashed even tho i have a premium every song and music that i played it always crashed especially i tried to fix it a lot of times and still not working,0
its very good and probably my most used app trouble is i cant find how to access lyrics i have premium and i just deleted and reinstalled the app in hope it would work please could someone help me if possible,1
been using spotify for years now i really cant fault it ,0
when i pick my favorite song it will be another song pls fix that,0
good for music not a good platform for free speech,0
i love this app its great not gonna lie the ads can be a little annoying but at least they are short and sweet,1
the skipping limit is a dumb paywall but i enjoy using it on my console   ,1
stops playing audio on bluetooth unusable app horrible app in general cramming unwanted things down our throats instead of developing the app,0
great app should buy premium to allow all extra cool attributes that make it better than usual music apps ,1
i love this app but the only problem is that adsi like that they have lyrics in songs although its a good app,0
this app is amazing you can listen to quality music anytime any where,1
how many ads,0
loved spotify and have used premuim meaning i pay for years now however for at least two months now the app has been crashing randomly pausing my music and not displaying any banner or display for the active audio ive been very patient and stuck with an app i have appreciated but that might change if spotify does not fix these issues soon,0
if youre on android this app wont let you play any songs from your phone only the chorus and thats it its impossible to get any songs to play on your phone unless you play something from another device,0
i have downloaded this app to listen to songs not your ads,0
keeps putting stuff on my playlist,1
good and fantastic app for music,1
the app stops every 10 minutes gets stuck on one song and the time bar doesnt move since the last update it doesnt actually show that it is playing any song at all when i click on the song it plays it but there is no  button so i cant even pause it it needs to be closed in the background ive had this issues on and off for over a year now on my galaxy s10 tried uninstalling and installing again didnt help got s21 now and still same issues,0
spotify music its okay only thing i dont like about it selects songs that i dont want to hear there should be an option for the songs that i like to enjoy,1
too many ads in it,0
iam really enjoying the music no doubt why it has that much downloads but the advertisement in the middle of the flow nah i wish i could get premium but i couldnt but thank you to spotify for providing great music and readymade playlist thank you guys,1
little to no access to actual new music spotify only has access to the pushed pop artists and will give you only those artists it will not introduce you to new music or artist as they come out unless it already has a contract to promote that but not by your actual taste unless your taste already matches that mainstream wash of the consumers of guided  limited controlled entertainment,0
i enjoy this spotify app totally worth it ,1
spotify is an amazing app,1
the best music app but now i cant listen to part of the music before i put it into my play list i used to be able to,1
very easy and pleasant to use the ads are annoying,0
ad breaks replay when you rewind find it annoying when an ad interrupts the thought or sentence want to rewind and replay the last sentence without an ad break nope the ad will play again when you play over the same point maybe its intentional but if so why would i put up with it maybe its a glitch and youll fix it i guess you dont test your builds before releasing them once again why would i put up with it im just gonna uninstall and download the raw audio,0
this app music is so great and awsoome it plays all my favorite songs the only thing is the ads keep bothing it,0
spotify rocks i hope they never mess up with their algorithm like youtube did,0
theres a problem when adding music to playlists it doesnt allow you to preview the songs anymore,0
repeatedly stops during a song updating uninstalling and reinstalling doesnt work,0
music for any mood at your finger tips,0
excellent travel with me all over easy acceablebest 70th gift from my children,1
i cant take specific song off my queue one thing soundcloud wins at,0
i have a bug or maybe a setting problem my songs in my playlist keeps mixing when played  the songs play shuffled even though shuffle is turned off wt i actually mean is my first song is montero the second is someday so after montero ends it starts playing some other song and not someday plss help me with this,0
spotify is a diverse and almost endless resource for music and podcasts that my whole family enjoys i always find what i am looking for no matter how unusual it may be,1
one of the better music streaming services,1
loving this app find all my favorite music on here,1
man it would be nice if i didnt have to watch five adds just to play a song after opening it and also it says ill get 30 minutes and no it doesnt i should get a couple hours if i have to watch like 10 ads just to watch 2 song that are like 5 minutes long like please just fix this i wouldnt buy premium anyways because i just want to listen to my music for at least 4 songs like come on spotify i have downloaded this before and it had no problem ever since last update it hasnt been the same,0
was working well until the newest update it bow looses sync and wont display what is currently playing unless i close the program and restart it,0
im not able to share my playlists anymore without making them accessible for everybody gives an no internet connection error on recieving device also sharing from playlist menu vs sharing from inside certain playlist somehow gives different results basically its a mess and hving to learn that spotify made my playlists public without asking me is a move that will alinate me from this software provider in the end,0
add an option to clear the whole queue in one go takes too phone storage,0
easy to use everything is easily obtainable,1
i always hook up my phone to the xbox so i can listen through my headphones as i play but the problem is that i have it set to full volume and its still quiet i tried seeing if there was any settings i could use to change this but its only on mobile not xbox,0
rest all is amazing the only problem is the large number of advertisements the moment the mood lightens advertisements are thrown on my face which makes it annoying many times please do something about that too,0
worstin whole day ads are more played than songs better download ganna or wynk or else spotify will continuosly beg you to buy premium,0
good music selection and recommendations but not liking the option of waiting to have a skip,0
spotify was great until all of a sudden i logged out for 1 quick second and now i cant load into the app and im stuck in the loading screen with the logo for the past 3 days itd be 5 stars if this was fixed,0
super,1
the best music app ive ever used cant wait to go premium,1
it plays every song i could ever imagine having to think of and it is very useful,1
spotify is great but when i want to hear a specific song it plays a different song idk if its just me,1
it keeps crashing a lot this past few months probably the update but needs to be fix,0
edit 0906 they fixed it thanks who ever signed off on having the go back button replaced by the like button in the notification bar please reverse it people dont click like on songs nearly as much as they click on previous track,0
better than i thought damn keep the awesome work,1
i dont like how when im listening to music it just stops right after its done and i have to go back to the app to press play for the next songits annoying to do that consantly,0
when it tells you 30 minnies of music it is actually just adds the creator should fix that,0
ease of use it would great if the app can remember the lat podcast i was on,0
highly reliable and entertaining,1
this app always freezes takes forever to loadskip songs and always plays heat of the moment by asia its a very bad app,0
overall a good app except sometimes the lyrics are incorrect but still a good app,1
i love this app one downside - the free version doesnt allow you to pick or reshuffle and the premium is stupid expensive i cant afford ten bucks a month oh well ill deal with that other than those two things its awesome,0
the is perfect music app but sometimes it shows no internet connection  but all other apps works fine,1
every time i open a new instance of the app to listen to a podcast i previously started spotify junps to the next commercial spot ussually at the end of the episode and i lose my spot in the playback been happening for months,0
very nice app for listening songs ,1
its a very good app for listening music but there is a scam or what that it says 30 minutes of uninterrupted music but ad shows up after 23 songs,0
absolute trash with s22 ultra skips podcasts disconnects from bluetooth starts playing randomly when i get off a phone call turns offf out of no where what the hell,0
1 if i search for a song i dont want a shuffled playlist that contains that song somewhere in it i want to listen to that song 2 why does changing playlistssongs instantly start another round of ads for 30min of ad free music if i literally just got done listening to 3 ads saying i have 30min of free music get more accuracy and less ads on youtube all places,0
at this time performance is erratic restarting phone provides temporary relief not worth subscription,0
i enjoy listening to music and spotify does a great job at producing the application,1
how do you turn it off when youre done listeninginstead of just pausing,0
i payed to have prime and i still get dum pop ups the software is maga buggy ui looks like i started to put over the fire and is melting the app doesnt respond the app doesnt uppdate when needing to and the only way to fix it is sigout but hay bunch of music in one place and for a good price i use the app around 7h a day,0
one thing i hate on my phone is notifications the second notifications that dont go away or show up whenever they want seeing as i use my phone for my music source 3 of the time there is no reason that spotify should harass me and clog up my notifications when the app is closed in the background uninstalled it to make it stop,0
needs a serious update barely functional crashes randomly play button disappears nothing in the library section will load offline despite being downloaded,0
cant open after clearing catch data,0
this app is disgusting the lyrics are not coming for available songs also,0
the only reason i use this app is cuz its the only app i dont have to pay for my music but the amount of ads is horrendous i get you gotta make money but damn over 1 billion people use this app i dont need an 5-6 ads after every song,0
doesnt have everything i was looking for but it has way more than i was expecting,1
i tried out spotify years ago when i got a free trial of premium from pandora and i have never used any other music app since i absolutely love the made for you section that curates songs based on what you listen to ive found so many new songs and artists i absolutely love and i wouldnt have found them without spotify just get the premium its 10000 worth it,1
spotify is great they have everything you can think of to listen to be it music or podcasts,1
great app recommend itcommercials are short and enjoy not overwhelming,1
amazing and undoubtedly one of the best music apps out there just a suggestion add a feature where when you click on any line of lyrics the song starts from there,1
its an amazing music app i love it and use it everyday you can find any type of music you like or playlists you like its really easy to use ,1
great for both music and podcasts easily the subscription service that i use the most,1
it was so bad when i want to play a song a ad pops up and when the ad finish it changes the song,0
great app but the playlist need to be fixed on mobile,0
enjoy,1
app never works right i pay for premium and still get ads,0
the app is one of the more comfortable apps in questions of music streaming the premium can be a bit expensive especially since i pay it for add skipping and selecting music also it can be buggy or bit slow would give it 5 stars if the premium was a bit less expensive but besides its good,1
this app is so bad you only get 6 skips per hour but yet they add 10 random songs to your playlist you cant even put your song on repeat,0
it would be better if it was like the spotify on playstation where you could choose what song you listen to and have unlimited skips this just sucks though it would be better with more ads and without the 2 features i mentioned,0
you could never go wrong with this one absolutely amazing spotify,1
everything is good but one thing there is no shuffle option to play songs in playlist  if it is there it will be best  please add it as fast as possible,1
app works for the most part the play on other device is a bit spotty since a recent update it keeps turning off shuffle please leave the shuffle setting as set by the user,0
i have been an avid spotify user since 2010 and i cant have anything negative to say i used many other music apps and this has by far been my favorite since highschool i do believe i will not change from here and premium has been worth every penny from me over 8 years straight of premium and still again no negative things to say spotify keep up the tunes so i can keep up my volume,1
your offline uhh no im not how come ymusic is free frok ymusicio and works and this app is constantly broken im connected it works,0
wish it would work right doesnt show controls or anything in notification bar like other apps constant updates never see any changes but you better update cause itll steadily glitch if you dont itll lose my place or just suddenly end a podcast early kinda sucks all around this will probably get deleted like my last review,0
the app hasnt been working for a long time the play button disappears all the time even after the upgrade or whatever spotify need to fix there problems fast or else im finding a new music app,0
third time google has deleted my review spotify promotes podcasts that spread misinformation,0
nice to have music in your pocket while you hard at work,1
love it just wish the free account had a few less commercials other then that love it,1
lyrics are not available in any song,0
i dont understand how spotify manages to screw up their app so often i just want a simple app that will play my music when selected spotify cant seem to figure that out im gonna switch music services if it not fixed asap ,0
i love spotify i use it in my tesla my office on my phone,0
the ads are so annoying  there are 3 ads in a row like are you serious my cousin only get 1 ads but i get 3 why,0
have to uninstall and reinstall every few hours of playback or playpause buttons will disappear and app becomes wonkyunusable this used to occur every 2-3 weeks which was fine to deal with but recently it has become a daily occurrence,0
amazing and great you get all different types of music and you can share with friends and create podcasts and playlists,1
highly pleased with the spotify app - functions very well on my phone and tablet as a business i respect that they have stood up against calls for censorship it seems to be a great home to podcasts for people who want to be informed and think for themselves,1
hate the update more difficult to find songswhen searching saved library latest update is even worse playing no play bar wont stop playing,0
trying to use spotify app as a controller for my computers sound system often glitches out,0
great podcasts for work,1
after pressing the song that i want to hear its playing another random song today i am using this app for the first time and my mood is completely ruined because of this app please fix this issue i want to be able to hear the song i like not just any random song,0
the amount of ads is insane let alone the amount of covid ads you receive my escape from the flood of news is working out which gets ruined because of the ads i can understand some ads but more than a dozen in 30 minutes is ridiculous,0
too many ads,0
best music app ever thanks for supporting students with the student plans,1
all i can play are playlist,0
beauty,1
so far the apps works fine please strike a deal with umobile malaysia so that i can subscribe from them and dont need to buy gift card anymore for 3 months subscribtion tq spotify,1
why do you have to wait one hour just to skip songs in a playlist,0
this is a great app i love it so much my only complaint is that theres no way to re-order songs in your playlists but to be fair im using an old version so i cannot complain i would totally install if you havent already,1
it keeps playing suggested songs and i have found no way to turn them off it irritates me a lot and others are having the same problem as well other than that its great,0
sometimes the app will stop intermittently and it needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled,0
i highly suggest not getting this i have tried 3 months now to cancel my subscription it says its canceled yet they keep taking funds from me try to comtact support but there isnt any human recources or human customer service just written suggestion amazon music is way better then this junk,0
awesome app but too many ads mostly 30 seconds and unskippable,0
its not workinh i have the best network and it says no internet connection plz fix ittt,0
ive been using spotify for a couple of years now and its good but still a little bit upset that there is no podcasts funtion,0
bad aap,1
im not gonna lie the app is nice but the fact that you can u cant choose if you want to shuffle or not,0
urgent fix please unable to have control ov playing stop or skipping music now the play bar has a mind ov its own now hope it can b fix soon spotify has been awsome for the last 8 years till now,0
less data  more songs,0
new update messed it all up wont play in car or pause on phone i have had too uninstaller twice im running android 11 and have a 2020 leaf,0
honestly i dont see anything wrong with this app ive never had any issues with spotify or anything like that,1
it would be nice if they would fixupdate the app so the play bar would stop disappearing and we wouldnt have to restart the app,0
please fix the app it keeps crashing it was fine before the update it wont show me what im playing currently anymore whats the deal spotify,0
they are giving too much of ads,0
good adds,1
very good app for people of all age group and excellent for senior citizen,1
cool app but some songs are no loaded,0
brilliant music able to choose what i want,1
used to love spotify but something happened in the last month where the app quit connecting to the spotify app on two separate head units in my vehicles would be a shame of they did this to force people into buying the spotify car thing,0
always love music especially gospel,1
aggressively shoving podcasts particularly joe rogan in my face im here for the music leave me alone im considering the move back to winamp if things dont change,0
i havent been using for long but its a good app i like it a lot but i just dont like how they keep adding more songs in my playlist and its getting really annoying i also dont like it when i have auto play on it stills plays music that not on my playlist like whats the point of having it if it doesnt work its a waste of time this was a 4 star review but know its a 3 star,0
love mostly everything except what was the point of removing the ability to listen to a preview of songs before adding them to a playlist please add this feature back- ive seen a lot of people complaining about this change,0

love the app absolutely amazing i just wish the the destiny 2 witch queen soundtrack was available to my region,1
stupid app wont let me play certain specific songs its always on shuffle play without premium,0
its so irritating this should be a state of the art app and it is when it works but its constantly crashing the controls keep disappearing it turns off randomly and its unchanged since the latest update do better spotify,0

great music i dont like ads and easy to use,0
fantastic music everything that i like no matter what era they have everything i need ,1
please change the plus button back to heart,1
spotify is pretty great i now have premium but before hand the ads werent that bad i definitely use this app on the daily for sure great music and suggestions to discover music too,1
songs have been glitching with interruptions during streaming for a few months now i have deleted the app and reinstalled and the problem still persist will go back to amazon music next month if this issue isnt fixed by then still no information on your hi-fi lossless either damn shame,0
it would be great if there was a listen later feature that you could add artists your friends recommend to you in the moment,1
good,1
one star for the way you handled rogans story completely disappointed and frustrated by your decision to support disinformation and misinformation just because its profitable probably the last days i pay for your services,0
it is all good but when i am playing a song it just shuts down and the app closes i tried uninstalling and everything but its just not supporting,0
i dont know if a bug or not u can open the app but just the logo that u can see i bin waiting for hours bat i can go to the app,0
ads are fine but please please let me choose a song,1
music keeps on stopping for no reason downloaded playlists as well,0
spotify is great never have any problems doesnt crash,1
please bring back the shuffle button im fed up of my playlists starting at the beginning and playing the same songs over and over i dont give a stuff about adeles demands not everyone is a fan of her depressing music,0
gone down hill incredibly quickly more ads than ive seen before  even when compared to youtube sometimes the currently playing bar doesnt even show when you start a songplaylist and you have to close- open the app a few times to fix it,0
this app is the best music and podcast app ever it might get a little touchy but is very reliable,1
 this app you search for the song and it finds your songs for you just hit the if it is a it means it saved it to your list,1
help full or nice app show only one app spotify play now,0
very annoying app for the android version yes i am using the free version but it does not mean i cannot back track a playlist only giving forwardnext track option cruel thing you have got i still prefer the pc version and if you like get the windows version spoilt too,0
very informative helpful podcast,1
its nice to have music at my fingertips,1
no issues  no glitch can find music most wouldnt listen to ,1
what a fk why it is turn off within a song i have to open it and play that song from beginning always  its frustrating can you guys help me out,0
i love spotify especially for my get togethers i make a playlist and just let it run i also use it for my podcast lifeofy my mother uses it as well and my kids for workouts and parties love how you can que songs so everyone can hear something they want,1
my favouraite songs ellame ketka mudiyuthu,1
ive used spotify for probably 9 years now its earned the 5 stars great app free version and premium,1
i love spotifymusic and podcasts i get listen to the best music,1
there is only one single reason this gets a 2 instead of a 5 because it annoys me every single day if i ask my google home to play music on spotify and then later on connect earbuds to my phone i dont want spotify to suddenly switch to playing on my phone so that i can spent 2 minutes trying to recast it,0
i love the contentbut this app continually crashes the podcast keeps playing but there is no way to stop it without closing the app completely been this way for months,0
i would give a 5 star rating but since i only listen to podcasts no music unbeknownst to me until after i signed up for premium wanting no ads and speaking to several customer service reps i was finally told that the no ads only referred to the music portion so why wasnt that advertised better yet how come i spent upwards of a total of 3 hours with customer service trying to figure out the why i was still hearing ads when i was listening to podcast ,0
please fix the app because when i listen to spotify and go on a game it doesnt let me listen and my tablet just crashes,0
it is really a wonderfull app in which every song is available of each artist spotifys function are also perfect and this app is easy to use,1
so far for the month cost its all good,1
spotify is the worlds best music app it it very fun to use when you are board or just wanna listen to music or podcast or even make something,1
great only problem is that sometimes it can glitch out a bit but it doesnt do that often,0
adds ,1
update 41222 why cant the programmers just make this app work right the play bar display goes away so have to restart the app to get it back,0
tunes podcasts concerts no commercials just great music great app thanks ,1
i am having issues when i cast my phone to my tv or ps5 the screen freezes on the first song i play its froze on that screen whether i go back to the main page or not cancelled my sub after a year without resolution ps pay musicians more  for their exploited work,0
good over all but needs some work in the ads,0
bring back the feature where when i select podcasts in my library each show is listed in order of most recently updated and has a subtitle saying when it was updated knowing if an episode came out today or yesterday is useful information most podcasts drop different types of episodes on different days please stop removing useful features for no apparent reason still buggy every time they patch something something else starts acting weird again having premium makes no difference,0
i love spotify especially playlists and the premium features,1
wonderful app easy to use,1
its very easy and amazing streaming as well as listening platform i found many new artists from the spotify recommendations the wide range of music it provides is awesome from regional songs to songs as per genre its very easily accessible,1
everything went smooth until recently when canvas toggle suddenly missing even after multiple reinstall and restart please fix it and im not on data saver,0
lately the app has turned to hot garbage and is unreliable for casting and keeps dropping out it works fine with other apps so its not my network plus spotify allows deliberate covid misinformation to stay on their platform sort it out,0
a best place to listen music any time anywhere now its a part of my life,1
the experience is out of thi worldjust wonderful ,1
so much better going to spotify via duck duck go than the dont be evil were just playingstore,0
always add tunes i dont like id rather use my data on stuff i like not wasting it on deleting s on the verge of uninstalling the app i dont have broadband etc so really annoys me,1
this app has an option to enjoy 30 minutes without adds yet i strongly recommend the premium plan no adds and the offline music is great but buying premium comes with a better quality sound its definitely noticeable i strongly recommend this app,1
its amazing but took me a second to learn how to use most features,0
i love spotify ive had it for years but lately its been so glitchy and im finding myself using another app more now really hope they fix these issues,0
very greedy cant we just skip ads and why do we have to play a music in shuffle if you dont have premium,0
music library is completely disappeared even liked songs disappointing wasting my time and money,0
too much ads,0
first time usinglove the music selection and ease of using the site nice job guys thanks,1
very nice app  but too much ads,0
i love the lack of commercials and the fact that i an play things up to 35x speed,0
i bought premium a few months ago and it is definitley worth the money 1110 absolutley spectacular,1
vide range of songs and quality of sound is superb,1
great but too many advertsafter each trackreally,0
the best music and podcast ive been with in a while,1
what is with this update- i also suffered the same thing everyone went through here what-,0
recently has sooo many bugs i have been a premium user for around 8 years but in the last year the app has become very annoying to the point i am now thinking of cancelling my subscription for one of the competitors,0
very good app for music ,1
unfortunately spotify doesnt seem to be able to push updates that arent loaded with bugs playback pauses unexpectedly,0
its awesome app i really love it ,1
i love this app as i love listening to music,1
both base and premium are top notch wonderful absolutely bloody brilliant ive been using spotify since 2012,1
too many ads,0
my experience with spotify is great i like all the virility of artists and i can search for anyone to download and enjoy,1
love it,1
keeps constantly pausing even after turning off any data saver or power saving options on the phone or spotify,0
the app used to be great lately it is so ridiculously flawed im not even sure why im paying for premium anymore to keep things short it simply doesnt function too must frustration for what its worth,0
really good for meam very happy now all types of songs here,1
crashes all the time,0
good streaming service however the lack of lossless audio in 2022 is inexcusable,0
an ad every other song glitches all the time suggested songs are repetative and annoying,0
when i updated this app i cannot play a song it automatically out the app itself i tried to uninstall and install but still the same please fix my account,0
love this app but lately been annoying the music bar to skip and pause songs on my lock screen and on the app itself keeps disappearing i dont like having to close the app to get the bar back i talked to my brother and he is having the same problem with this app plus my music sometimes stop playing randomly which is super frustrating when added to the problem above,0
im using it for 2 years but i am facing problem in log in in my new phn idk why is happening help me as i travel long journey to my office i need spotify with with in that particular time,0
glitchy have to keep restarting it suddenly stops playing i think the glitch is triggered when the on screen ads pop up,0
love it,1
i cant play the song ive searchtap it shuffle a play list instead,0
its amazingly awesome although one downside is they have the band disturbed on it thats the only bad part about the app,1
an amazing app since the day i caved in and got it years ago also an open platform for people to share whatever ideas religions opinions beliefs etc - that they want a platform that doesnt censor freedom of speech hooray,1
this spotify is simply awesome unfortunately this time i dont know how could be this happened bcs when i tried to repurchase weekly premium by using phone credit the unable to connect always occurs several times whenever i click the button on the screen therefore i cant use my premium eventhough this app has been updated please repair this problem or give some actual explanation thank you,0
it was good when it worked shame it wont work anymore,1
its perfect you can listen to any choice of your song any time anywhere,1
playbar on my android has been disappearing or not working for days now youd think spotify would rush through a fix for a major problem like this before people started bailing,0
to many ads but overall a good app,1
excellent all around thanks,1
from many days the songs sound is not clear every song sounds like an echo,0
cant even go to albums after the new terrible update first rule of software dont fix what isnt broken too much worrying about joe rogan and not enough on the actual product,0
the ads are getting to much and are annoying the app stops on random which i have to re-open i am basically repeating what everyone already said,0
app has consistent glitches,0
spodify is cool the only issue is you cannot play your favorite song on repeat unless you pay so theyll play music that youre not even interested in which is the biggest con,0
spotify this app is amazing because my mood is very bad in sometime so i hear the music from spotify feel good and i have no words for this app because this app is amazing ,1
after spotify installed i stopped using youtube for music  please add feature like requesting song to add in spotify collection there are lot of small music artist who produced amazing songs and musics example speaker of the house-your galaxyfeat goldan,1
awesome ifonly they had kiwi classics like south side of bombay would be a 5,1
its very useful app for singers,1
i was not satisfied with the update its not just the same as before,0
easy to use and great choice of music ,1
after the update unable to play the songs of my choice only shuffle mode works which doesnt even play all the songs from the playlist another issue is tht only 5 to 6 songs can be skipped per hour ,0
love the app but i have a small issue i havent figured out how to shuffle my playlist i cant figure it out i dont see the option at all,0
great app you have made i have a request that you remove prime user in spotify or gave us free,1
wont play anything that i select it just gives me a black screen a little mad since i just paid for premium,0
the only reason i give 4 stars is because yall keep adding songs to my playlist like bruh i wanna listen to songs i like stop doing that shi everyday i gotta hide songs yall added to my playlist to listen to my songs that shi is annoying,0
please bring back the dragable slider in your liked songs,0
this app is the best even the non premium is convenient,1
no problems immediate quality music unlimited options of genre,1
spotify it is a very good app ,1
i say 4 bec i love this app but i only get to here the songs i already heard over and over sometimes but other than that it is good,1
i tried this because of all the fuss in the media until then i wasnt interested having tried it ive ditched ipod and this is now my go-to for music my mum and dad love it too because theres something for the over 60s try it yourself we doubt youll be disappointed,0
ill admit ive used this app for awhile with premium an it has worked for a good amount of time but now my liked list doesnt update with the music ive added from the playstation app this is the only reason im giving it 3 stars for now update im not sure what you have done with this app since the last update but it has not been even loading up properly for me and the music name doesnt show up on the bottom when its playing do any of these updates get tested at all,0
got rid of car view dumb decision specially when it worked perfectly,0
its a great app has worked perfectly across multiple phones my sync system in my f350 operates it for hands free it does take a little time to figure out the bells and whistles of it but once you do it works great oh and it works with my android tvs and i can control them from my phone with the app as far as music is concerned good job devs,1
one can create multiple play list and each with different type of music very flexible and intuitive menus and more,1
used to be my favourite app on the phone but last months its so slow and bugs a lot its almost impossible to use ill probably stop subscription,0
this app is a complete rip off now they play 3 ads per song worse than a fucing radio do not waste your time downloading this,0
absolute garbage it was good before they made shuffle and ads after every song a requirement on pc its fine but on mobile it very different at this point i can write a 200 word essay on how much it sucks on mobile,0
everyone always recommends this but the songs that can be listened to are not as many as youtube music sometimes you can only find the cover instead of the original song,0
spotify gives me the best mixes i love it,1
what is this i open the app but the app not start i try all time i check my mobile network then i use wifi network then i reboot my phone but the app not start if the app not work i uninstall the app and i say all dont download the app,0
i love the app but auto play sucks even if i turn it off it still plays songs that arent in playlist please fix this issue and when i search a song and try to play it gives me a playlist and i have to got through half of it before i can find the song i want i also hate that if im just being dumb can u please explain how it work cause it keep giving playlist instead of the song,0
excellent application and service have used for several years now and never had any issue,1
best music app there is nothing beter,1
brilliant got the family free trial opposite to sis and deffo thinking to carrying on with as already set up daughter who 4 with spotify kids which is easy as i dont have to keep turning off bad language and put her dad on going to put son on now he can have own email as turnt 13 still got five family member left so going put their granny on so deffo might carrying paying as love it and quite easy as 4 year can get on and select music by herself,1
awesome app but why no christian music all genres are on there except that one thats so weird ceo must be a devil worshiper or something,0
nice but i miss being able to download songs pls can i be allowed too ohh i realised the only reason i could download things was because i had premium,0
the app keeps crashing on xiaomi poco f3 on latest update the last version had issues too but this has made it worse,0
phenomenal site for all music,1
doesnt work for me i can get all the menus to load and i can select what i want to listen too but when i choose anything it just buffers and nothing plays really sucks to be honest,0
app is alright other then whenever i get a call on my phone the next song starts playing in the call which is verry anoying,1
loop and shuffle dont work,0
i really love spotify but i dont know why i dont have the lyrics,0
since the may 16th update have not been able to play any music on my phone re installed and all my playlist are gone cant even search for a song it wont play very upset and her we are again with another update that did nothing to fix the issue update a month later and still not able to play any playlist goodbye spotify thanks for that lovely update that took everything away,0
fav app the ads can be funny but olny let you have 30 mins of not ads,0
friends system is absolute garbage its near impossible to start a group session or add friends its down right broken,0
control panel is disappeared which disallowe to switch or stop music i reinstall it number of times never had a problem with previous version time to say goodbye to subscription ,0
absolutely hate the change theyve made to the group session it was so much better where everyone could connect to the one phone playing the music - now its forcing every phone to play the same music even when were together change it back,0
best music app after purchasing premium ,1
updated - nice app with great recommendation all songs available now and so even better,1
good music and easy to browselove it and very useful,1
perfect app  thanks spotify ,1
its a great app but theres constantly updates which are annoying,0
recenty had an issue with the control panel reinstalled the app and its working now,0
enjoy different types of world-wide music though i would like to skip the advertisementlol highly recommended the broadcast at spotify,1
best app if wanna explore some new songs that you havent listened already ,1
hate this update i cant even look at my playlist and choose the song i want to listen to anymore thats so annoying,0
no way to see all songs by an artist i dont deal in albums so i have no clue where one song is in 20 albums wont be payong for premium again,0
paid for the premium and enjoy the ease of use with no ads would give it 5 stars if the free version didnt have so many ads and you could select the song you want on your playlist rather than having to listen to it on random,1
this music app is great,1
i cant even load ina any playlists anymore in offline mode or in online mode we have a very strong internet connection i tried installing and reinstalling it multiple times and its getting frustrating,0
very pleased as do family subscription just bit expensive,1
love it best music app ever i travel a lot and go to rural areas with poor or no coverage at all my offline music is always there to keep me company,1
i just dont understand why you need premium to be listening to the music you like the old spotify was better,0
it wont let me listen to my music and they keep adding random music to my playlist,0
this app best from all music apps excellent app forever,1
increase the quality of the music i cant connect this app the app says that not connected to internetbut i have been very fast internet connectionso repair this problem,0
local files are not showing anymore since this new update released do you have any way to fix this,0
the only real good way to get straight on music in this world,0
it plays music no need to elaborate,1
amazing ,1
been paying a 10mo sub for these new updates to brick spotify and cause the music to cut in and out at random when i turn off the screen the audio just cuts out after a minute subs are a waste of money this is a much needed reminder better to buy physical albums or dl off yt,0
app is good  but low lofi hindi songs is there not like resso aap,0
15 apr 2022 update the buttons disappear so you start playing something then it becomes impossible to pause like or skip tracks without restarting the app something is obviously broken in a recent update spotify has been so buggy for most of the time ive had it when i get time ill seriously look at cancelling premium and switching to a competitor,0
love spotify but i have problems with the app crashing like others also the ads are horrible if you watch an ad to get 30 minutes with none you usually get one after like 2 songs,0
work really well with android auto on those long drives home,1
im glad spotify didnt become complete cowards and ban rogan him and lotuseaters are the only reason i got this app,0
i am having a problem listening to my fave lisas song money it doesnt show on todays top hits please fix it,0
worst experience ever the ui is difficult downloads dont download i got this thinking i could put music on my phone but all i got was a headache and a monthly bill that took my like a solid 20 mins to figure out how to unsubscribe from,0
i wanted to reinstall the app it was working weirdly together with another player installed and deleted it now it says the app is not available for my device turns out i paid for premium so that i wont have ads in my no music and could skip between any of no tracks why thank you well worth it 010 coincidentally i cant even buy a new phone easily because someone brainfarted when designing esim tech and its harder to transfer esim to a new phone then a physical sim card - and i would have to go to another country for that my experience could not be worse,0
cut the ads good ,1
does the job minus the ads but its bearable,1
id like to say that spotify is free yes but really makes you fight for it they shove ads into your face of only buying premium and they dont allow you to listen to what you want to all the time on mobile at least,0
the music player is randomly disappearing on pixel 6 i have to force close the app and reopen to get it to return very bizarre,0
this app is amazing  i can find every song exist  and one thing that this is add free  add free music at free of cost ,1
app is good but its constantly cutting out when playing or just stops playing songs altogether and have to reset it every time and its not cool when using for workout music esp when i pay for premium service i expect it to work,0
1 star is more than you deserve,1
for a better experience just buy premium i really recommend it ,1
great app i just wish you would add lyrics edit fixed thanks,1
so far my experience has been amazing really love the app loving the ease with which i can find my favourite music and create playlists,1
actually this app is awesome like whenever i feel bored i just listen to music and it just energize me everyone should try this promise you will not regret after downloading,1
very problematic for mobile phone users i hope they will make it as smooth as pc used app,0
how do i enable the voice assistant in spotify ,0
excellent music app,1
spotify is the best app so far for listening to music and i really loved it,1
nice mixes but i wonder who came up with the genius idea to force sync music between devices id like to listen to separate stuff on my pc and smartphone instead i have to constantly switch playlists also no idea why you dont allow viewing previous songs in the queue i thought that youtube music had bad ux not so sure anymore,0
super easy to use and the best app ever,1
i support the way spotify deals with prima donna artists like neil young ill change my tune if spotify becomes subjectively censorious or caves to niche special interest activists,1
we need a play last option to add a song in the queue pleeeeeeeese,0
the apps okay and i like that i can close the app and the music can continue to play in the background however i cant get it to stop playing in the background unless i pause it my most major issue with this app is that every time i try to play a song that ive already listened to before in the past it doesnt play the song it plays recommended songs from the recommended playlist and i have no idea how to fix that also my playlist wont play the correct songs,0
good to got all your music playlist save somewhere,1
i need to download songs to listen in offline but there is no option to download songs,0
spotinazi stole my money i had premium subscription for a year until 060423 and its just been deleted scammers,0
this is the app i use everyday and it was fantastic but in the last couple of months it has been breaking up multiple times during songs almost like it disconnects at first i blame bluetooth ear phonesbuds so i replaced them but it has not made any difference it is doing my head in it alway freezes and google home  for my speaker  has to take over to be able to control the tracks which is not possible on the ear buds please fix it,0
since the latest update the play and pause buttons disappear all the time,0
amazing this is a must have if you wanna listen to good quality music ,1
great service and good playlist and recommendations,1
the app is so slow slow to open slow to load slow to switch speakers slow to load library slow to show playlists please optimize it no other apps behave this slow,0
i loved it but now its annoying you keep adding stuff to my playlist and wont let me listen to my liked music,0
awesome application for listening songs i just love it ,1
i can listen to the music while using another aplication,1
this is very nice music platform but we only write the name of acters and singer not songs name,0
plss fix your app its hard to use what the heck all the songs and playlists shuffled play i cant even play the song i want because its shuffled even though a song isnt included in the album there are also many ads plss fix it btw im not angry i just asked for a little request on spotify,0
the app isnt opening stating that there is a bug preventing it from opening,0
maybe i will rate it 5star after i have maybe enjoyed the spotify,1
ye buhat acha app h mujy is se kafi faida hua,1
have premium and it was hands down the best decision for my music they recommend songs and create playlists based on songs and artists you frequently listen too i am always getting put on to new music by spotify and i love it,1
i did love using spotify not anymore since im annoyed that all of my playlists are gone for some reason,0
amazing i enjoyed hearing melanie martinezs podcasts and music videos here i love the new spotify update  go download spotify for free now i am not a bot but i just want people to notice spotify ,1
awsm app  it shows all lofi songs also its great   also unplugged album song ,1
is great best app ever it just has a little bit of glitches but thats expected when you listen to it more than 5 hours a day,0
i give this app a 1 because there is a problem i always click on a song and put another it is so bad,0
this app doesnt let me skip the songs and add additional songs to my playlists,1
spotify is really good app but please management can you give me a little favour by removing olivia rodrigos photo from made for you i love that album and automatically made albuns in it as well but her photo makes ut annoying there are many more better artiss than her i guess why spotify should gear my request because applications are made people friendly  artists only share their songs please accept my request,0
spotify is very easy to use its one of the best music apps out their if not best,1
i love the included songs but i dont like how they try to add new songs to my liked songs i think they shouldnt do that and just stick with the playlist,0
this the best app among all but they give more adds but surely this the best platform for listening songs i just luv it voice quality best they know what you loved to listen  and must say that if you have to choose definitely pick spotify ,1
your irritating ads every 10 mins are not encouraging me to buy premium but rather switch to switch to some other app,0
no words to tell about this app i love this app so much,0
it has been the best songs that i cant listen to on the radio thank u so much spotify i love u ,1
wow this app is extremely perfect i am wondered by this app features i am wishing spotify team get more profits,1
almost all the songs i want are here great app,1
its been fine albeit a little bit buggy for the past 2 years ive used it but recently spotify has been trying to download music over mobile data even though i have the setting turned off,0
very excited about music choices,1
awesome music app spotify as everything i want to listen too,1
didnt give for bc of the restrictions for ppl who cant pay make one for the poor that have ads but dont lower the quality i like the app way better than other players j,1
it was great until this new update i cant listen to any of my liked songs and random songs are appearing that i dont even like,1
this app just stopped workinguninstalled numerous times reset the cell cleared the cache and still not workingfamily premium member and i cant use it very frustrating,0
always have the music i love to listen to  lots of artists i hadnt listened to that our now faves,1
this is my go to for listening to music and the jrp but man i absolutely hate the fact the they locked the ability to skip whatever songs you want behind a paywall i dont mind the ads,0
what if while i was listening to a daily mix it didnt change also im glad theres no shuffle button at the top of albums anymore a big green play button is nice ,1
locks up on almost every ad have to restart spotify sometimes its so bad you need a phone reboot this is only because of the ads my son has a paid spotify account and no issues at all,0
its very good i use it all the time but one thing is that i dont have the repeat button and it really bothers me,0
i havent had any problems with this app i have been using it for a long time i would just like to suggest that there should be an option to select a few songs at once to add to a playlist sometimes it is a bit frustrating to choose songs individually,0
best music platform around period nothing compares,1
i am truly enjoying spotify on my phone and google speaker all the music i like i can program spotify,1
best music app used by me so far if your having any issue with ads just get the premium its awesome,1
i absolutely love spotify i have been using it for years unfortunately recently when i go to add songs to a playlist i cant click on it to hear a preview of that song and i really do not like that it was one of the most helpful features in my opinion,1
i wish that they could let us hear music or songs without the wifi cuz if i have trips i could listen to music or songs cuz i was on a trip and i needed to listen to songs it would be great change 3 ,0
the recent updates has made the app worse by now just hanging on the splash screen i dont pay a family plan for a non working app also the new ui is horrible,0
nice app ,1
been using spotify as my primary source for streaming music for roughly 8 years now ive even started my own channel only one thing i cant figure out how to delete a private playlist,0
so i was playing a song and then there was a werid voice that is not in the song it sounded like a 10 year old and i was very confused lol but this app is really good even after that,1
horrible no network message when i just downloaded the app,0
worst experience as they show many ads i hated this app,0
app is pretty easy to use hate commercials,0
i own 1000000 worth of i tunes for life but spotify is much better to use there have been several times i have requested a more extensive coverage and complete diskorgraphy of some well known artist and groups and spotify has expanded these there is now easier to use choices of how to create playlists and for many songs real time lyrics makes it easier to understand the words and make your favorite songs much more singable youll like spotify,1
there are so many ads and its shows no internet even though my internet is on,0
the best we can find any music in this platform,1
spotify is good app but the main fault of giving two satr is that he dont play those song who choose me and play a rondom song plzz spotify do work on this fault i am done with this fault,0
awesome app,1
its an amazing app and my favorite way to listen to music the only thing that i dont like is how many features that they dont allow you to use without spotify premium,1
i used to love this app now when i click a song it plays another song ,1
2 stars because i still can listen music online and listen to my podcasts thats it its been more than 1 year since i was able to download my playlists without having to contact support or create a new account,1
i use it daily and absolutely love it,1
i started to use this app a week ago because its impossible to use youtube with tons of ads but yesterday in spotify i was listening 330 sec ads before i can play music and after 2 melodies another 330 unskippable ads it doesnt worth i wanted to purchase premium version but no - not when i am a hostage,0
very nice app,1
why doesnt this app work on roku ive already deleted and reinstalled,0
i would like to say that this is the bestest app of songs in my life i dont know i just feel so good when i play songs in it,1
awful i bought your premium and spotify only works on my computer and playstation but not on my phone where i need it the most when i open it on my phone and look at albums or my liked songs everything is empty and theres a try again button when i press it nothing happens all my music is missing and everything ive searched theres not a single playlist that works its infuriating to me to have been a spotify user for years and theres nothing online to fox it or any customer service,0
its really good the ads are alittle unbareable sometimes but im having issues usally you can loop songs and anonymous shuffle playlist on spotify for samsung smart tv but when i click loop on my samsung tv its not letting me loop at all but the buttons are still there can i get any help to solve this,0
no longer connects to my devices had this issue on different phones does not work with my bluetooth stereo anymore music will play but says disconnected,0
so easy to use and so good cause ypu can listen to music even when youre phone is turned off and when on other apps,1
disappointing i have paid for premium for several months now and recently ive been noticing issues when streaming music at some parts of the song the audio would completely get cut off i have 0 issues with the desktop its really frustrating,0
excellent quality of music and collection ,1
it is very good for music and podcasts,1
why does the app just randomly start playing this gets annoying please make a change in the android app to have an option to turn off autoplay,0
this app is very very super duper nice,1
needs hi-fi quality but otherwise the best out there,1
every now and then the media player wont launch which means you can cant fast-forward rewind or skip thru playlists of podcasts and occasionally the crashes,0
best app for music playlists,1
problem i cant deal with this app anymore for a while now my app hasnt been functioning right when i click to play the song i want it puts a completely diferent song on  so i can no longer listen to a song i want improve pretty much every song is explicit so could you maybe change that thank you for reading  ps please fix these because it was managing fine for a couple of years ty ,0
owh very nice to this apps because all your music is already her,1
the app is excellent but we need an update for the audio quality,0
it would be good if you could include accoutic and live concert versions more,0
the best podcast platform,1
theres one request for spotify please add recently added songs,0
its the best music player i ever seen,1
love the app but im having a lot of issues with playback i cant control the playback on my phone or in the car via androidauto hope this gets resolved soon,0
nice,1
frankly speaking i recieved more than 3 ads in just 5 minutes its not spotify i guess its adify even your share button doesnt work,0
philistine,1
quality and reliable,1
the payment has been twice and still not credited and sometimes the app stops working how can i get my 129 which i paid twice back,0
great app for finding new songs and artist but this last week has been stressful pauses by itself for some reason the toolbar to pause or skip song doesnt appear when phone is locked please fix,0
better than pandora im a premium user for 2 years now with the old hulu bundle i love it,1
w music app if you just get premium just get it bro its goated,0
works well and easy to navigate,1
ads have become terrible literally less on youtube being you give artists essentially nothing of the revenue might be time for a switch,0
very good app for free music,1
constantly stops playing not an ideal app for someone who cant have their phone in their hands non-stop to be able to restart every song,0
songs stop playing after 9 seconds,0
its hard to figure out if you dont have tech knowledge,0
great app all songs available at a single clickamazing,1
installed on my phone but i couldnt get the app to close like i can pandora so i uninstalled it knew there was a reason i dont use spotify even though they have a huge selection of music,0
amazing ive been a premium member since 2019 but i recently switched my music to my sd card sadly it keeps pausing so i resorted to uninstalling then reinstalling the app  please fix this problem update so unfortunately after having this problem i had to redownload every song album and playlist all over again to even stop the pausing,0
love it got all the songs that you want to hear very good relaxing not too many commercials i recommend this all my friends,1
great app but i really do wish spotify would include loseless audio for a much better music quality,0
pretty good music app for creating preset playlists very easy to use the main complaint i have is that unlike in the computer version there is no way to disable it creating playlists meaning id you want to listen to just a particular song you have to skip through multiple other songs using up your daily skips if you are a free listener also sometimes it will bombard you with two or three ads in a row after you skip a song overall however i enjoy this app,1
amazing experience but too adds,1
basic control issues with the most recent update when you play anything after searching there is not track box pop up at the bottom of the screen so there is no control over play pause or skip this is obviously a serious usability problem when you have to shut down the app to stop it playing please sort this out asap,0
borderline unusable these days controls not showing up after you hit play things ive downloaded take forever to show up when im offline playback stops randomly almost every 15min really hard to play local files the only reason i havent cancelled my subscription is that i dont know of any other alternatives that do what i need fix these stupid bugs or im out,0
honestly if joe rogan wasnt on here i would have you tube music but i have to say ive gotten pretty spoiled on the user interface pretty easy 5 stars,0
i love spotify but in the latest update the play button has moved from being between the skip and backskip buttons to be to the left of both of them this makes me physically sick whenever i look at it i genuinely consider cancelling my subscription,0
i have used both napster and amazon music i have to say that i find spotify to be the better app i love the fade feature more importantly the car safety feature only grumble i have is i wish it had more equalizer functions like concert etc  awesome app very happy,1
i cant get myself out from the house or car this music is the best thing i ever need to get my situation going on with the music you have it is such a variety of great music so keep up with the good music you guys i love it ,1
love spotify great service for the price,1
i have spotify premium family account but im unable to add more devices to the list it is a shame,0
thank you for reducing the ads,1
as much as i love this app  when i got premium it was a little better the one thing i would say was when i forgot my premium payment it wouldnt let me log out and when i didnt have premium it was ok a few glitches here and there but no too bad for me but if it was different then it would be better,1
i use it each and every day love it i cant remember when i used the word pandora spotify is much more superior,1
its good i need help why cant i put stuff on loop anymore and why cant i select songs from my playlist,1
they stole my song and the rights  i dont recommend it up to you guys if you want to still upload ive asked to be reimburst for my song and they paid someone else and have yet to get back to me so i will need to sue  use youtube and boycott spotify if i could go any lower than 1 i would  evil buissness practices almost died in process of getting a single paid out neil young good for you  dont trust spotify  i got your back neil  good riddance eat a peach,0
its so good that i have it on lop and i listen to it every day wen im on my ps4and my phone so its 4 stars for me only because i have to listen to it with wi-fi but i love it,1
disappointing i legitimately tried spotify even paid for premium to have the full experience but honestly i cant justify how poor this experience is to be fair music is ok nothing special beyond other services but for podcasting this thing is bad in the most basic ways its inconsistent in remembering where i left off not to mention whether ive heard an episode or not  plainly it fails to meet baseline features  im honestly surprised theyre as popular as they are,0
this app sucks ive been using it for years and had no problem but when i create a playlist it puts random songs on it that i dont like and i cant listen to any songs that i like bc it keeps playing other song that i did not even know existed if i could rate it a zero i would but i cant so i give it a one,0
i guess good for everyone who likes to listen to music offline mode but other than that is pretty good 9510,1
i have crashes almost daily things play well out of order i have to close and force stop the app daily if this doesnt change ill be canceling my premium account the only good thing i can say is at least i can download stuff but i can probably do it somewhere else,0
this has been a great deal with the best variety of affordable music to suit anyones tastel,1
good selection but has playback issues regularly cuts out for a few seconds for no reason at all,0
theres no way its been a year and you guys have not fixed the new terrible uiux for crying out loud my sort playlists toggle turns off every 2 minutes or when i exit the app and what im left with is a mix of unsorted artists podcats albums and playlists bunched together to this day i wonder why you guys ever even made this move you guys were probably just bored and needed somthing to fix huh well fix it faster so many missing features now so many things wrong with it so many bugs,0
the music quality the lyrics and podcasts are the best i think the paid version is worthed but im not sure why every time you open the app always says there is not connection and you have to wait like 1 minute the others apps i have in my phone works perfect with cellular data,0
last update introduced a bug where the currently playing bar doesnt show,0
love this app best music app around,1
ive paid for spotify for a long time and now there are technical issues all the time like when i pick a specific genre it wont allow me to play if i wanna shuffle bc im not feeling a song it wont let me the only option is pause im about to switch to something else i love my music to much to pay for this many issues i only stay bc i hate switching and spotify is connected to all my devices at home and on the go,0
horrible playback hardly works when you want it spotify needs to pick up the game and actually fix their problems,0
i dont like it at all everytime i try to get a podcast it says its been taken down ok then i try to see the content removal and it literally says nothing you couldve described what was wrong with my podcast then there are some songs with the lyrics all wrong and the songs i want to listen to arent there therefore 1 star i will continue to use soundcloud,0
i love the app but since the updated library its been a mess in my opinion it has not brought any comfort in use nor did it make it easier to use i ask of you to change it back and since a few weeks every time i use an other app with audio for instance youtube and come back i have to close and restart the spotify app because it says nothing is playing and either i can play something and not control it or not even play anything at all this is a major frustrating factor,0
its a really good app but i sometimes find it hard to discover new songs,0
disgusting app doesnt alow you to play some of your favourite songs without premium membership,0
been using spotify for many years never any problems and great content,1
i cant play my liked songs or open links whats going on,0
best for music with all the latest songs,1
i have never left a review because this app was perfect now it stops randomly several times while playing a song and it doesnt show what song is playing fix this or im ending my subscription,0
best app i have found in play store for music and for podcast ,1
really good selection and the ads arent that bad  i actually get a lot of candy ads n and up buying reeses lol  im enjoying using it at home outside doing yardwork keep carrying joe rogan and small artists like the sober junkie and whiteloaf ,1
the only music app i can trust ,0
need a break from the ads,0
i usually love and defend spotify with my life but for the past couple months its been crashing and not showing the pause or skip button its weird,0
play by shuffle only and hear the preview cant choose song to listen it sucks and what do you mean by we added no i want to listen to my playlist,0
it is an exceptional music app as it covers most of the songs,1
it plays every song that i dont want to listen to,1
great place to be lots of lovely and superb music to reminiscence with,1
good app and many good choices they have a playlist for all your favorite artist and those playlist play the artist,1
great music suggestions and the app works great,1
not about to tolerate all the ad issues this app has so they can pay people who spread dangerou and pathetic misinformation bye spotify,0
just love it they have all different types if genres and all my favorite country songs a d my older sisters podcast is on here too yall gotta check it out expecially if your a true crime lover then youll definitely definitely definitely love their podcast death over danishes hosted by jessi crow and ann vargas check em out yalls yall wont be disappointed thats for damn sure deathoverdanishes,1
when i say hey spotify it doesnt work,0
jadore but like can you just let us see the lyrics on all songs  less ads please ,0
i am a premium user and i cant access music downloaded and i have tried redownloading it but it is still not working,0
tojhu,1
hi premium user here your latest update for android has broken bluetooth connection for pioneer head units again please fix thanks,0
great music app and sharing platform menus choices are a not intuitively placed requiring you to explore but works well,1
a great app with all the best music,1
very good app it also automatically generates lyrics even the meanings are not correct i appreciate the creator for a good app,1
when i reinstalled the app and trying to login it is showing something is wrongi m not unable to login,0
of course its good but the way it takes over my cars bluetooth and wont let go no matter what you do is a huge issue why does it auto play every time just make it stop horrible horrible issue,0
i love this app i have been with spotify for over 10 years,1
love this app i enjoy having lyrics available in the app also the following features for artists and friends are awesome my suggested music is always incredible spotify has opened an entirely new world of music for me,1
third class app i cant even loginits always failed to login,0
best app,1
very nice but sons should be select through key words,1
i have got to be able to listen to music every day and you have it here you are better than must i say utube music and you deserve mystery and i mean every word thank you i am going back to spotify now,1
i like this app but the only thing i dont like about is that you can skip and choose your songs on a computure but not on your phone unless you bought the premium version,0
recently when i leave the spotify app if something is playing the spotify notification bar isnt displayed at the top  when i open the app the song is missing but its still playing so i have to force stop the app smh,0
great music application ,1
best app to listen to your favorite song,1
the app updates keeps on crashing,0
i cant turn off the shuffle i only use it on pc now cause of that petty disappointed to be honest but it still work on my pc,1
they charged me multiple times without my permission and i am still trying to get my money back dont trust a free trial from this app i will update when if i get reimbursed i did not even use the app while i was being charged,0
spotify is the best music and podcast application but its gonna be better if we can share music in ig stories and there is music coming out as well,1
love the access to a variety of podcasts,1
i have been using spotify for 3 years its wonderful,1
the app is very slow and stopped working so i contacted customer support and was passed around to 8 people who all just kept telling me to logout and login again and uninstall then reinstall in 5 hours 1 person actually was useful until they just asked dumb questions again i have not been able to listen to anything since right after i was billed and when i asked for a refund it said i couldnt bc is was past 14 days but i paid on the 6th and its the 19th so it hadnt even been 14 days,0
very fantastic app for your favorite songs,1
i love the service but there is always something wrong with the app something has to be broken and when it gets fixed another thing breaks it used to be rock solid,0
its a good app i been using it for a few years i can enjoy everything on this app keep up the good work,1
the app keeps crashing keeps stopping and pausing for no apparent reason i have this app for one exclusive podcast and the cost-benefit ratio between enjoyment and frustration is tipping very seriously in the wrong direction,0
4 years later spotify u freaking still rock but more everyday ,1
why it it that when i get 30 minutes of ad free music i get 4 ads 2 minutes later other than that it is a good music app,1
its good on mobile as long as you have premium,1
the app keeps getting stuck on an ad and doesnt show my saved playlists but i dont face this issue on the desktop app please work on it spotify,0
i love the download offline option but for the past couple months it looses all the downloads after a few days super frustrating when you dont have reliable internet 247 especially when youre paying for it,0
good and easy to use,1
was logged out out of nowhere and now im stuck in login page tried every troubleshooting steps in their website but to no avail my brother has the same phone make and model but his spotify is working fine,1
lots of bugs now i am facing spotify sometimes not showing songs images and also artists profile picture please fix those issues ,0
youre kidding you quietly deprecated the one useful amazing feature for pioneer head units i litterally purchased my high end pioneer head unit not even 6 months ago for this feature and this is what im greeted with and these head units are still being sold on store shelves promoting spotify connect go shove it spotify i see a lawsuit heading your way,1
since the recent update app wont load at all and is unusable,0
new bug found where the ui for controlling the music which is playing doesnt appear making it impossible to change tracks or pauseplay music,0
great platform that ive been using for years i can get almost everything that im looking all my music anywhere i go radio based on  great for discovering more new music,1
spotify is very very very because there is so many songs all about like oriya hip hop songs hindi songs marathi songs gujarati songs all be conducted in that app and you also hot in train in bus and any other place so i think so sporify is best for me also and and spotify is best for you also,1
i really like spotify is ah really good music appyou can choose your favorite songs and have them on your favorite list and you dont have to search for them,1
why do i have songs i did not put in my library and what is it whit only skipping 6 time whenever i skip its becausei want to listen to a particular song but yalltaking that away,0
it would have been five but i cant download any new songs but i have the space but they wont download,0
12 ads in a damn row this shouldnt be able to happen,0
good,1
video never works always crashes and just doesnt work properly my podcast will cut out and start over randomly i love when it randomly loses my place and what im listening to and plays something else boggles my mind that people actually pay monthly for this app,0
its okay,1
the app has had a lot of issues lastly it suddenly stops playing the song i am listening to and the now playing progress bar keeps disappearing i cannot even listen to 2 songs in a row now can this he sorted asap,0
great podcasts easy to navigate,1
i personally enjoy spotify i really do suggest it when no other apps let you create long playlist ive been with spotify for some time,1
amazingonly wish is provide more to the caribbean countries,1
i enjoy that spotify doesnt run my battery low quickly  i can listen to spotify while browsing the world wide web  i can turn screen off and spotify continues to play while i exercise to my saved playlist,1
you keep removing songs that were available less than a day ago along with being slow and freezing up more when go to the liked songs,0
got trending new gospel songs that i love and the lyrics where available to assist with learning some new song,1
its showing that im not connected to internet believe me i have tried everything even i asked for help in customer care service provider of spotify they were giving me the casual ideas which i already knew bruhhh i came there cause i have done attempts already and you are a service provider  so dumb  welli tried to make new account too but same its not working im so done with spotify,0
best,1
nice,1
spotify is be really goodtry it out for yourself,0
dear spotify youre claims are false you do not provide 30 minutes of garrented uninteruped listening instead you make these ads appear after every song furthermore you chose to make these ads scarce so that this claim can not be challenged but on that note here i stand on another note you chose to hide the users selection behind 6 or more songs making it improbable that the user will be able to happily use your app without using the using the 6 skips provided per hour750characterlimit,0
you can listen to music while turning off your phone ,1
amazing music app,1
unless you pay for it its terrible you cant even listen to select song you want to hear without listening to a ton of songs before youtube is easier simpler and it has a wider variety of music youtube is just overall just a better platform than spotify its ads are even shorter and theres less of them on spotify ive deadass gotten the same ad 4 times in a row,0
its the best app i love it i can make playlists and listen endlessly and a k-drama dailogue i have no chingu playlist was nice and i made those types of playlists for fun i love this app this is best app for music ,1
not working well with assistants recently spotify isnt responding 90 of the time to assistants bixby bixby routines google assistant on samsung s22 and s20 ultra nor google assistant on the samsung galaxy watch 4 are opening and playing songs on the app properly anymore i have to constantly close and reopen and even that doesnt seem to be fixing the issue most of the time anymore i cant get it to work at all on the watch with my phone,0
podcasts a bit glitchy but great platform overall,1
fix you stupid bluetooth connext im having to use an old version of the app because you broken bluetooth connect functionality,0
they choose to platform misinformation on top of that their ads just repeat over and over in succession its nauseating,0
best music streaming satisfied with my browses in metal music make the other albums available please for the premium users and please add the hifi cd-quality already please,1
the app has been great in the past however- the newest version from mid-april hid the playpause controls randomly and the app also intermittently pausesplays after a few seconds especially when the screen was turned offlocked there a loads of complaints can spotify have an intern monitor the app store reviews and let the devs know business as usual i emailed the address on here and got the stock answer of reinstall the app completely nojust patchrollback hello,0
i tried youtube music gaana jiosaavn and wynk music but came on a final verdict that spotify is unbeatable,0
i love listening to music i can get all my music and playlist here try it out,1
whats up with the volume being too low on android auto its way too low,0
its the best especially if you have premium,1
this app is cool but is a glitching my album but the martin garrix problem in songs in fav there song is 1 follow 2 limitless 3 reboot 4 good morining and why is glitching the song can you fix the app but i updated to one ui 40 is ok is to litsen i like ot really cool is black desgin i love that ,1
this app is great but everytime im listening to my liked song list a song that isnt on the list or a familiar artist pops up and play i have to delete the app and download it back and that happens when i add a new song so can you plz fix this,0
best app for listening music we can find any song on this great app i use only this app,0
hellllooooo spotify when are you going to fix the disappearing now playing button im paying for a subscription but the app on android is almost totally useless ridiculous that you havent got this fixed yet,0
only problem ive ever had is that you cant pull up your downloaded songs on your liked playlist,0
generally great however a repeat of individual tracks would be a welcome addition,1
lots of ads very unhappy,0
they have made a lot of updates  fixes since my last review i am loving spotify again i use it every day all of my previous glitches have finally been fixed no complaints here except for the desktop version its a bit messy visually its hard to navigate because it looks so different than the app id love to see desktop minimization options like a widget,0
i wish the sound quality was a bit better,0
switched from googleyoutube music to this and have to say its so underwhelming really buggy app takes ages to open cuts out randomly if signal drops to half then music stops cant see what the hype is about at all,0
spotify is very conveint way to listen music,1
songs playing time unvantad ads coming in spotify,0
i constantly have to re-download all my music when i find something new to download and i have a subscription and phone has room it always just spins and doesnt dl i follow all the steps recommended and in the end i have to reinstall it re download everything fking pain in the a if it didnt have such a large download limit id have gone with youtube instead i miss google music,0
too many ads it says ad free for 30 min but the ads continue after 3 songs,0
smooth experience loving it so much,1
good music app but worst irritating adds avery song play after add comes,0
i like spotify but recently the app keeps on crashing and when i want to update it it doesnt work eveb though i have huge amount of storage left,0
great never not been able to find a song,0
mind blowing,1
great app,1
spotify has the best user experience,1
local files cannot ne read anymore please fix,0
so  suddenly any and all r slash podcasts just refuse to play  this is weird ,0
phone app keeps waking my pc up also connecting to chromecast audio is always a lottery annoying,0
love listening to great songs,1
why is it that i cannot play my downloaded songsplaylist if i am offline this makes me frustrated even i turn on offline mode in my settings the reason i am into spotify is that i can listen to the songs even i am in offline mode,0
annoying and inconsistent in its operation,0
its a really good music app u til your free trial is over and nothing works until you buy something,1
slow down you get 6 skips per hour literally doesnt let me listen to musicwants me to buy premuim to do it i want to listen to this one song and then it goes opening something else and when i click on the song it lets me preview it for 5 seconds yo cash grab ap0 im raging so hard at this just let me listen and skip stuff s2,0
i cant listen to music anymore without premium om moving back to soundcloud,0
very exceptional experience love the automatic play and genre,1
have been a fan for many years and i am sure many more to come thanks spotify for being part of my life and that of my familys too,1
this music app has too much ads,0
very good ,1
what has happened with the app ive used spotify for the past 8 years or more and its always been great now music will just stop playing i cant pause skip or go forward because the lower menu bar is just gone  please fix it,0
great for offline music and has a wide variety,1
i love this app but you cant swipe down to see the lyrics on android and i wish i could so maybe could you fix that thank you,1
all the music you could ever want and access to podcasts the vendors dont want you to hear,0
its a great app but it always keeps it on shuffle play,1
i love it ,1
if you think that by adding 3 ads after each song a user would get so annoyed that theyd switch to premium then youve been mistaken in this way youll only lose users whod switch to apps better than this was the best before is the worst now,0
this music app is amazing like it has the lyrics for every song and the lyrics are even time synced love this app,1
spotify allows me access to an increasing eclectic array of media from great pod casts to banging tunes,1
never had any issues using this app i will always have this on my phone ,1
has some buggy music features but pretty good premium,1
pretty awesome  some new songs not on this there on youtube though hopefully we will see the new songs come to this app it rocks and has joe rogen so im a customer always thanks spotify,1
i would love to take your premium i desperately want your premium but all i have is either rupay card or upi and you take none of it you dont know how irritating it os for me to miss so many offers when i really really want your premium,0
so bad i just want my songs so when i made a new play list to get rid of all the songs they added it literally put 500 extra song i rate one or zero,0
satisfying - because good music in good quality relieves moodiness and exudes happiness so why not spotify,1
the best aap ever for music but the prblm is add but the aap is sooooooooo good,1
new update is wacky sometimes it shuts down by itself interaction on car audio i cant tolerate it anymore i wish i didnt update it,0
hdiidijj perfectt,1
the app may have a large library but it lacks the basic feature of a search engine when i search for an artist why doesnt the app provides a sort method based on views or like counts when you open an artist page you can only see their top 5 songs top 4 popular releases but complete discography which is totally useless in my opinion whats the point of showing all songs of an artist when all i want is to hear their best hits then maybe i will give their other songs a try,0
amazing love it,1
it sucks too many ads,0
old songs compiled nicely,1
at first it wouldnt play through my phone but i have been able to use it lately so i hope whatever problem there was is gone for good,0
great app couldnt do without it,1
too much ads  its ok to show ads but its too much,0

spotify needs to give me a marketing job because ive converted my entire family into spotify users and a bunch of other people i am however younger than the legal age to be hired so give me a job when im older sidenote im also my familys dj for everything i even have a playlist for my funeral,0
this app is very good and very interestingbut i choose to give it four stars because a person cant switch themes at anytime heshe wants,1
liked it a lot  it is easy to use the app and also can be played with slow internet access only problem is ads but overall thats the best app among all the music playing apps thanks spotify team for it,1
its very nice app cause you dont need to download any song if your network is slow then also you can hear songs so i love it,1
i like spotify because i dont know any better,1
easy to filter and set favorites,1
one star from 4 until they fix this latest version player widget disappears has issues with android auto too ugh,0
bring back the feature where you can listen to parts of the song before adding it to the playlist please,1
ive found a ton of obscure music that i used to listen to that i thought was lost forever absolutely love spotify,1
it seems like the music controls skippause are not working for android phones and spotify has yet to address it all the solutions and links they have provided are deadends please address this,0
i love spotify but i get irritated because when i play then after 2 songs or even halfway of a song thats currently playing it stops it literally stops and when i get back to open the app the song restarts so i need to play it again or skip it and waste my free skips please fix this its not like this before i enjoy using spotify but with this i really get irritated,0
can always find the best tunes on spotify we love it,1
fabulous,1
great app easy to use,1
whenever i open the app and numerous times while using it i get a message that i should turn on bluetooth i know bluetooth is off i turned it off there are no bluetooth devices where i am it has become so annoying that i am looking for an alternative,0
release radar forever on shuffle why wont it let me listen to the songs without being in shuffle please fix  everything else is great though thank you,1
the best of the bestie been with spotify for 12 yearsjohnny logan and other artists are personal friends of minehappy new year spotify,1
i dont know what you guys did with the recent update but the app is so glitchy now it doesnt show that im using it in the drop down menu anymore if i start a song it wont show up so that i can change songs anywhere until i close and reopen it its constantly stopping mid song and i have to restart it to get it to work,0
whenever im listening to my playlist some random songs start playing that i never heard in my life,1
great app i use it to remenber ols songs muy satisfecho,0
bring back the preview song option in the add songs because making playlists without it is literally the biggest pain ads are okay but i do not see the point of only letting us shuffle on mobile i can just use my computer to choose what i wanna listen or switch to another music app that lets me choose my songs instead of making me shuffle my playlist if it werent for these issues it wouldve been a 5 star review,0
forced ads on podcast now at least ad something other than annoying music,0
too many ads on the base version,0
its an great app for music i just love it,1
new update is messing with the app keeps closing when i skip songs or it pauses my music randomly i pay for premium fix the app thanks,0
i have a complaint  spotify app will be not working on my device please clear the complain sudently ,0
i use spotify almost all the time for music there are a few kinks being worked out but its otherwise great,1
i like the podcasts and i used to listen to audio books on you tube but i think ill keep listening to spotify,1
i cant seem to access spotify originals i dont know wether i need a subscription or there is another problem hope can get back from the app,0
i enjoy your app and enjoy listening to the music of many artists,1
i only watch for joe rogans podcast he is the best,1
todo bien,1
great music selection on ny playlista wonderful music app in general,1
i love it make a lot of events valentines day april fools day etc then ill love it more,1
love spotify and the recommended playlist,1
so much good music app good performance and my favourite song is sigma,1
after i bought premium account it fails to load my playlists my like songs or anything seems like my account is resetted but on desktop its fine the app is not working at all,0
only gets this rating because i have premium with premium its the best thing on the planet and without it sucks,0
instead of this app you can use resso if you love mostly hindu songs i am not satisfied,0
finding the play controls should never be an issue but with this app it annoyingly is solution quit the app,0
app is updated have restarted my phone but keeps force closing please fix,0
it keeps telling me that i need to connect to the internet to use  even with my mobile data on and connected to internet so i havent been able to use it i cant even click on a podcast or anything without the connect to the internet screen coming up,0
for dropping support for pioneer and kenwood and changing buttons in layout more than 1 star is too much,0
synchronization between devices is the best part of the app too deadly,0
one of the best free app there is would recommend it to any music lover who doesnt want to pay for a subscription,1
it will definitely know what kind of music and songs you would want to listen to  a state of art music app ,1
simply the best music and podcast streaming app,1
best,1
nothing beats spotify 100 best app out there,1
as many others have stated the banner with stoppauseplay etc keeps disappearing please fix it spotify im tired of uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times a day,0
so enjoyable and relaxing ,1
why is the app version restricting than the desktop version 6 skips per hour and it doesnt even play songs in the playlist that i created it plays songs randomly,0
quite a few artists are now pulling their music from spotify so the already limited selection has now become less again now going to look in to other equivalent services,0
i cant listen to the music i like on my playlist so if you can fix this bug and other bugs that would awesome thank you,1
great music all time favourites useful application for those who travel often and those who love music -badhavi-,1
features keep getting removed from the free version you cant edit you playlist you cant put a song on repeat you cant put a playlist on repeat you cant choose a song from your playlist to listen to you have to start from the beginning and it keeps asking me to go premium at this point stop saying its free just make it all paid for and stop pretending that your services are free at all making a playlisting on youtube with adblock is easier than using this app,0
best music streaming app hands down,0
disclaimer this could sound like it is an ad but i assure you it is in my own words that i am not getting paid for end disclaimer whether youre up to your knees in mud riding a few waves back to shore on your kneeboard or if youre like most of the 7 billion folks minus children without question living on the 3rd rock from the sun youre most likely to be knee deep in something else spotify has the song for our minutemen or the playlist for the long distancers awesomest,0
lately the app has been riddled with bugs keeps crashing stops playing completely and also displays different musicpodcast to whats actually playing very annoying also slow connection even though every other app has no issue with my connection update on 12 apr 2022 uhhhh wheres the controls to pauseplay music great job spotify i have to actually kill the app to stop the music seriously considering moving to tidal,0
amazing i can listen all my favourite songs though there should be an option to stop the playlist when youre finished listening to it unlike how it just carries on with reccomended songs this is really annoying when you make a playlist but apart from that amazing app,0
music plays for a short moment then stops then starts up hrs later and stops again,0
the app doesnt work for me ive redownloaded it like 10 timesall to no avail its not accepting my email and ive tried several other emails it keeps sayingsomething went wrong please can you fix it,0
i only got to listen one day but i think its pretty cool,1
uncontrollable on samsung phone if not sorted id recommend migrating to tidal i will be doing so after easter if bug not sorted,0
doesnt go past the loading page,0
wide range of songs collection,1
i like the quality of songs,1
for some odd reason it is keep playing random songs when ever i try to listen to my playlist,0
i cant pause or click next on my basic spotify plan  please fix,0
not good after recent update i cant see what song is playing and it pauses at every notification i get,0
i got this problem when i cant repurchase the premium one would you help us to fix this problem the unable to connect always appears,0
like a lot of users software is flaky and works now and again hope they resolve issues soon,1
i enjoy this app and all the types of music and podcasts that it has,1
its a good app its assessable and easy to use do its really amazing i love you spotify your playlists are fantastic i recommend you spotify,1
is it too much to ask for one song to be played for free i understand you need your money spotify but i have to pay to get features that youtube has yeah no im going back to just listening to youtube on loop so i dont have to deal with this nonsense how do you expect me to pay for features that should be basic i cant loop a song unless i pay money pathetic,0
lock screen widget disappeared after my phone updated and remained missing after updating app 5 stars once this gets fixed,0
excellent love the service app works well,1
it has some small but annoying bugs,0
its a super cool app you will get all songs you want tho it has add but still working amazingly well when you have low range,1
this is the only app i use for music  podcasts,0
to get good and nice music,1
spotify mobile is a good way to stream music although it does get annoying to have advertisments every 2 songs they arent too long and usually arent terrible but for the love of all that is holy you gotta add the ability to stop certain ads from playing ive been genuinely turned off from listening to spotify because of that garbage uber eats ad that plays every break it doesnt make much sense to force tons of ads every 2 songs and to give the user almost 0 control over what plays,0
how is it possible to not be able to play the downloaded songs while offline then why did i download it at the first place,0
why cant we listen to some music when adding songs soo annoying n disappointing,0
best,1
well i would give it 0 stars but i cant so- but the real problem everytime i play a specific song it leads me too a song i never even clicked its like i cant play it no matter what its ridiculous,0
in devotional section why kannada song not available  im uninstall this app one u added let me know,0
the recent update introduced 1 issue most of my songs arent showing up as downloaded offline even though they are i have to pop data on for a sec to get them to register they are downloaded this is a pain when i have poor service this also doesnt seem to be just me because my friends have reported the same issue,0
worst app ever whenever i try to play any song some random songs starts playing what the hell is this,0
bcz of that its not easy to listen to the music while offline but the experience is good cz i can listen to any songs i desire,1
every week the app logs me out and i have to delete it and reinstall,0
good music app missing some songs i love charged me wrong once,0
can you remove this appalling new car mode feature its terribly implemented why do i have to repeatedly turn it off why does it take me back to the menu after turning it off etc just add a way to disable it its ridiculously annoying and just makes it harder to use while in the car,0
it wont even play songs on my play list ,0
it is really good app actually it is best whatever i want to listen  any music i wanna listen always  i go on spotify thank you for making such a brilliant app,1
love it so far,1
have always had good results in accessing the podcasts that i have wanted to hear by means of spotify i have yet to try using the app to access music though,1
good music but i had to listen to 7 ads to hear 1 song and after 3 songs ads were back,0
love spotify sometimes the app is glitchy but it could be my phone been paying premium for over a year and will continue,0
i love it and its great on the road at home or enjoying with my friends we all love spotify so good job and keep at it,1
i really enjoy spotify it includes all my favourite podcasts,1
good app,1
pointless unless you want to pay you cant actually listen to the songs in your playlist and it randomly plays songs that you never added guessing because you dont have the premium version,0
has to stop playing me russian songs  i only have ukrainian songs in my lists but more than half the songs its reccomending are russian,0
5  5  very best sound quality is also very good i hope spotify will rely just limited ad just like now all time thank you,1
listened to all my fav music on the go,1
spotify is the perfect app for listeners fans and creaters to share and inspire lives,1
worst app i have ever used when you try to login it shows that it has an issue try later and not even twice or thrice but always please spotify either look after this or you will have trouble later,0
man this app is great but the problem is thatin this app there are limitless adsmeans if a person does not want to take a premiumwhy this app force him to take iti have experienced that we hear ads more than the songsso plz reduce the ads limits,0
its very good app,1
great human story - great interview where the interviewer draws an amazing story from jay gaffey - looking forward to pt 2,1
i love spotify aside from the fact that random people join collaborative playlists now and they seem to refuse to believe this or do anything about it there also isnt a feature to report random people for joining your playlist and adding songs by their band as promotion and deleting your songs this has become a real problem that spotify refuses to address and instead they claim no one should be able to join without the link when they clearly are,0
its very helpful enjoying both latest and old songs,1
this is good but from yesterday it is closing itself whenever i play a song i can say it is crashing nowfix this issue then i will change my review,0
like the app but the ui is like its set up by idiots cant even access a list of all songs by an artist i search so i can add to playlist and im a premium member tidal is way better,0
i loved the app and used it constantly almost every day but now since the preview song feature has been removed i barely use the app anymore as it helped me build playlists as well as helped me discover new songs i liked it makes no sense why this feature has been removed,0
i love spotify but why and how does this app keep doing its own thing and randomly opening itself then casting music to my nest hub both by bluetooth and over wifi,0
great music quality and selection,1
spotifys lack of consciousness and utter disregard for decency is appalling,0
great way to connect music of different styles i love the multiple choices of flavor and variety,1
i support the decisions of joni mitchell and neil young to remove their music from spotify im uninstalling the app because of spotifys annual 300 million payments to joe rogan who spouts dangerous lies about race the coronavirus and other topics of importance simply to shock spotify pays him simply because they make money off him not because of the value of anything he says i am taking my music listening elsewhere this is an easy way to stand up for truth-- please join me,0
i like the youtube music app better just my preference,0
one of the best song streaming,1
usually great but over the last few days whilst listening the app will just stop playing,0
im giving this one star because whenever i want to listen music on my playlist it just change in other song i hate it and it really annoys me alot and if i tap the song it just plays other song which is so stupid hope you understand what i mean because i just waste my time in this stupid app,0
the ads have gotten completely unbearable ill get four or five in a row before my music is played it also keeps recommending me and even playing songs from artists ive blocked which is a big problem because things i have blocked trigger panic attacks im completely done with this garbage been screwd over too many times by this lousy app,0
bring back the option to listen to song highlights adding new songs to playlist because a lot of time is music i have never listened to,1
its just sucks its got great collection but cant even play them without having a glitch once my entire library was wiped clean it keeps loging out and buggy connectivity issue so fix it,0
good it is just so limited without subscription,0
app is so fast searching suggestions are available when you type any song you will find soon it is better than ganna app,1
best streaming service on both android and ios i enjoy the premium since it offers you the ability to play music uninterrupted by ads and the playlists are simply amazing,1
i was fed up of hearing ads always after one song one ads soo please do block this ads,0
unable to play many kannada songs and some songs are not available,0
well its a amazing app for streaming music but i feel that there are a bit too much ads i understand they never the money but i have once gotten 6 ads in a row and they said i would get 30 minutes of ad free music but then around 10 minutes later i a ad but if you ignore that its a great app,1
i enjoy musici get good dopedopamine from spotifys range in jazznot so much soul eg lamont doziers you ought to be in picturesnot on thisnor is vaneese thomass geffen album yt has both and podcasts are interesting,1
can listen to music for free with ads but wont play what you pick good for a station i guess,0
ive been using spotify for over a decade would highly recommend students get premium for very cheap so make sure if youre a student you take advantage of that,0
its the best of all apps made to listen songs  go for it,1
i hate that i cant control what ads i hear i hate hearing crying baby diaper ads first thing in the morning id rather not use spotify at all than pay 120 a year to rent -rent- music,0
wish there were more functions in the free version but still amazing and great to music lovers,1
i love spotify because when u go to youtube to listen to music u can exit the app and listen but with spotify u can do that so thats why spotify is a good app,1
good app,1
bro give me the songs i want ,1
very cool app because i can not getting back with another event and i will be there at about the same as the one i have is a good time to come by and look at your schedule,1
i recently got premium and suddenly today everytime im streaming an album after the first song the rest of the queue is full of random songs not from that album why is this happening,0
spotify wonderfully wide range of music that i most adore  my rate 1010 grait awesome cool music,1
im suddenly logged out and im frustrated i cant get back in it was great but now idk whats going on,0
outstanding audio quality loved it outstanding ads in every other song begging the users to buy membership making the users go crazy to buy the membership loved it i would also appreciate if the spotify app would decrease the amount of ads to enjoy the free version of the spotify app and if the users can enjoy the appthey should be going for the membership overall loved it,1
every 10mins i play a song it crashes and its not okay,0
annoyingly buggy for listening to podcasts loses position ads can trigger a jump to the next episode hard to get back to where you were when the app messes up cant seek using android auto if not for joe rogan wouldnt use it at all,0
best music app easy and the upgrade is worth it,1
this is a first class app for music new old revival you name it spotify has it thats my reason for five stars  star ,1
tbh i really hate it i hate the fact that when i try to listen to my liked songs and im listening to melenie martinez then when the song ends and it starts playing some random song ive never even heard of and the fact that we only get to skip 6 times is kind of sad im really thinking of switching to a different music app i really like the app over all tho,0
itd be fabulous if you were able to see what your friends listen to also on mobile,1
songs keep dissappearing in my playlist would be a 5star if the problem wasnt there because its a big problem i dont memorize song name ,0
probably my most used app i use it every day and have never not used it full ratings deserved,0
i had issues with my app on my phone so i emailed and it was fixed so quickly same day i emailed great customer service ,0
not sure how to work this app music,0
i think this is either a bug or something but everytime i click on a song to play it plays like 10 other random songs i dont like at all until it plays the song i wanted and you cant even select one unless im just dumb and dont know how to work spotify,0
amazing music but lots of adverts which get o my nerves ,0
you can find almost any song on this app it has helped me through some tough times too so if u see this review downloadinstall spotify,0
love spotify sh its amazing man just dont like the ads it been running the vibe,0
a good app go enjoy yourself i prefer listening to music alone bc i can feel the joy and i love every features it contains its perfect,1
great cheap price also got bundled in with hulu for free the latest on all the music can find just about anything you want podcast for giveaways exclusive sweepstakes definitely at my highly recommend it,1
please fix shuffle i get the same songs constantly in a playlist of over 1000 songs do something to keep track of how recently and frequently a song has been played on shuffle,1
i bet the next update will require you to buy premium in order to breathe while using the app,0
podcasts are not being played all other music works though some podcasts have no playable episodes and some podcasts are working fine and some podcasts have episodes that are playable and some that arent there is no rhyme or reason to the episodes that are unplayable and the ones that are spotify was working fine until the latest update which may the cause of the issue please fix asap as the uues unpredictable unplayble episode syndrome is affecting a few of my favorite shows,0
if spotify had an option that allowed songs to crossfade when a user manually changes the song i think that would be the icing on the cake,0
best app for listening song,1
better than apple music premium,1
the support team didnt help me and kept blaming my me and my bank i missed 1 payment i tried to pay my subscription in every way possible but it wouldnt work and the bank told me spotify is the one declining my card i had money  and a working card but they just wouldnt accept my payments this happened 3 timedso i had to switch to tidal,0
i think spotify is an amazing app i use it for everything music podcasts background aesthetics and so much more the only thing i would recommend is allowing the use of spotify premium free trail without entering my login details i cannot afford to pay for the real thing,1
finally i can listen every queen song ever made,1
refreshing entertainment at the press of a button music for all any time anywhere and anyway,1
adds are almost invisible get this before they start charging,0
its nice but i dont have premium so i get a lot of ads,0
i got 5gb downloaded music data on my phone storage and tried to move it to my sd card in the spotify app settings but it didnt finished and now i cant open the app it says it is not responding im paying for this app now what do i do,0
good,1
the music selection is great and i have been using spotify for a long time now but the app keeps playing the same song or album over and over again even after closing the app entirely and restarting my device on top of that when this issue happens i cannot use the music controls to change the song and half the time picking a different song doesnt work there is still no clear way to speak with tec support to fix this issue will update when i have been contacted or the issue has been fixed,0
cant use any other app now that ive used spotify like its ui the one thing i wish it had was its previous group session the newer remote only group session isnt working well,0
please turn off the bluetooth headphone requirements we shouldnt have to solely rely on spotifys casting software to be able to listen to music via just the watch speaker every time i pause on the watch i have to play it from the phone again or the watch app wants me to connect a pair of headphones,0
i would also like to say that i pay for pro and the app was my favourite go-to for everything ive noticed that just in the last six months or so ive been having the same problem as others it seems  - with not being able to play my downloaded songs or saying im offline or just just bugs its beyond a drag and im considering cancelling my subscription,0
i am new to music apps this one is easy to use and has a variety of music thumbs-up,1
the app is good but sometimes it is not showing the music dialog box in the screen or in the app i have to restart againit is too frustrating hope spotify clears the problem,0
unable to open the app,0
keeps glitching and switching itself off which isnt good enough when you pay for it and rely on it most of the day,0
nice performance but lots of ads,0
unable to use i cant use the home menu as the only option in the bottom menu is premium,0
a lot of people on here complaining about the free version as if its supposed to operate differently than pandora honestly as a paid member i just want the app to function properly tired of the player not being displayed whenever im in or out of the app though,0
best music app out there joe rogan for life,1
i dont listen in any other app than spotifyso for me its like universal best app for musicand i use premium membership soo its kinda u know not getting annoyed by ads for a reasonthats why i enjoy without getting irritated,1
you guys need to do a better job of filtering your songs please home by snow aalegra is not an explicit song by any means what even and songs that are actually explicit still remain especially songs in other languages very annoying,0
the functionality is not as flexible as on pc,0
its pushing up to 5 ads in a row this aint it more often than not it plays suggested songs instead of what i actually put on my playlists,0
spotify keeps crashing on my new samsung galaxy phone needs an update only spotify crashes while all other apps work fine,0
music stops playing outside own,0
love this app has all the music i love and some i havent thought about in years popped up,1
the best music app ever,1
ill be playing a podcast but the app says nothing is playing the only way to get the sound to stop is to kill the app pausing music is a basic feature that spotify cant get right,0
all the songs are available and the sound quality also great the data useage is less in the this app but the ads are awfull,0
great app but hasnt been working on my phone for about a week whenever i try to play a song it doesnt play and when i click into playlists or search for songs it loads for a while and then the screen goes blank it works on my desktop but not on my phone,0
tone done the ads its annoying while listening a playlist or album,0
although the app is good its really irritating that the songs are played in shuffle like making this feature unavailable for free users was absolutely unnecessary we can play the songs in order on a laptop then why not on a phone this is such a simple feature and why is this not available for free users hope you can update this for free users as well,0
all i gotta say is spotify is frustrating asf to use,0
doesnt load at all on my s22 its a subscription based app and it needs to work more than 15 times i open it so frustrating search function is always broken and i just stare at an endless loading wheel no matter how many times i force restart the apprestart my phone etc,0
app is glitching really bad doesnt show what you are playing and randomly stops music please check it,0
really good music app,1
was working fine until it updated now music sometimes stops when on bluetooth and no visible player samsung s10,0
since the recent update my experience with the app has gone down hill not impressed,0
o-boy this app is amazing  i dont have any music and i dont havent gotten any cash and i dont spoke goodso much free music here that i can get to hear and load on my player to going outside with they tell me actually how and show me the way to get it done by myself and i can see why you are so sweet to get it done by myself liam oreilly ,1
really interesting but sometimes it misbehaves though the goods surpasses the bads love the app anyways ,0
great with premium membership on your phone and on other devices like consoles and pcs but without premium on your phone it sucks,0
thank you for saving me and giving me and escape during the hardest time ever in my life i do not know where i would be if it wasnt for that premium subscription and being able to listen to all of my favorite downloaded songs whenever times got so tough i wasnt able to keep my phone bill paid i swear i can hear something new each and every time what a listening experience now please re-verify my musician account again please and let me know how much do you and confused have made,1
very easy to use for an oldie who just started thanks martin,1
free listening with high quality sound really good,1
never had an app that literally ignores my imput garbage i search a song i want to listen to listen to the ad then guess what it plays sum bs not even related to the artist or song i want to hear okay no big deal ill just skip it then nope another irrelevant song i didnt ask for until i have no skips left and it never attempted to play the song or artist i wanted again garbage,0
the non-premium experience is horrible to the point of that it should not even exist if you dont want to spend money on listening to music then literally use any other platform and steer clear from this you should not support this business practice if you dont enjoy using the service please uninstall the app it really goes a long way to hurt the company,0
i like this  spotify is vary good app ,1
i love it because i can enjoy a variety of music including complete albums,1
its an amazing song player like it moves smoothly between each song and has a variety of music for anyone,1
this apps been really good although theres been an ongoing issue where whenever i go onto a playlist none of the songs show up meaning i cannot remove any songs and can only shuffle through them i would continue using this app if the bug is fixed also i dont use premium and im on android,0
good password,1
sorry im gonna give this 3 stars cause the update made it frustrating to use and theres no loop button anymore so please fix this spotify,0
the three stars is because it doesnt work properly as in the music doesnt play it glitches all the time etc overall good app,0
ive used spotify since 2008 and have always loved it but lately i dont know whats happening with the option to skippause a song i dont even seem to have buttons for this and if i want music to stop playing i have to force the app to stop if i want to skip a song i have to search for a different one ive always paid for premium but unless this is fixed ill look elsewhere i use it everyday so its super important it works well,1
my problem is that i chose a song and it sends me to another song i dont want and i am pretty sure that is for premium but seriosly premium to stop shuffling,0
you scewed this app up entirely with the last update i have had a subscription to this app for years but the last update is terriblei cant tell what song is playing and i have to go the whole way back to the playlist to change the song taking away the bar to tap on and it bring up the song playing was a horrible idea and it has made using this app a hassle if it is not changed i will be canceling my subscription its beyond infuriating not be able to just click and bring up whats playing,0
controlling other spotify devices is hit or miss sometimes daily mixes get out of sync across devices and selecting a mix from device a fails to start playing it on device b unless the app has recently openedrefreshed on both devices,0
its easy to safe and play my favorite tunes i have been able to hear and save everything that i requested to listen to,1
very bad interface stops plays without audio all of play controls gone,0
very buggy freezes wont show playpause menu etc wont save podcast progress sometimes or even restarts progress randomly hope they can get this fixed asap considering i pay for premium,0
today i was driving and streaming some podcasts and somehow spotify managed to eat up 10 gbs of data in less than 3 hours 10 completely unacceptable  now i have very limited data left for 2 weeks until my next billing period,0
999 for 3 months is what the standard should be no way will i pay anymore than that for this buggy invasive irritating and frustrating app when it works 100 its a great app unfortunately it typically falls short of that mark,0
its always been my preferred streaming service years and years ago i would use pandora and iheart and i liked those but when i started using spotify it like changed my life maybe let people without a subscription choose at least one song a day though that actually plays when they want it to because all those people that listen to ads usually just go to youtube when they want to listen to something special,0
love it works everywhere i go,1

for me you are totally awesome  thank you for allowing us to listen wen we can to our music god bless,1
spotify is nice to have its good for the ps4 too,1
i think spotify is one of the best music services in the world the song collection is incredible but other music services have better audio quality than spotify so spotify should add next-gen audio technologies like spatial audio but overall its a great app for music ,1
this is a excellent app i seen in my life,1
instant ready to playi love this app,1
i really enjoy the music but sometimes when im listening to music it pauses or something else plays or when i put it on repeat it plays like 4 ads and the changes the song but i still like the app,1
its a good app but recently i have had a huge problem with listening to music whenever i am using the app it doesnt let me leave the app and listen to music i have to stay in the app no matter what i have tried connecting to wifi for it to load but it does nothing i cant even turn my phone off or the music wont play,0

very irritating i want to stream music over mobile data and says no internet connection seriously furthermore i am a premium user but still suffer please check on that as soon as you can,0
at this point why doesnt spotify just cancel the whole service  i mean the app is completely broken due to the most recent update leads to a black screen on almost everything and i cant play a song,0
im still loyal to the app but im starting to stay to other apps because one day ill have specific singles and the next they are unplayable,0
dont use for long podcasts this app regardless of being free is just way too glitchy im often not able to listen to long podcasts from start to finish and need to pick up where i left off unfortunately spotify has some serious difficulty keeping track of where i stopped i try to continue from where i paused the podcast and spotify just fast forwards right to the end or just starts a new podcast from out of nowhere im forced to make mental or phone notes to keep track of where i am,0

app has a a flaw and a bug flaw when listening to a podcast and spotify gets turned off and lets say a couple hours goes by and its forgotten what you were listening too well good luck finding it again unless you added to to a list in advance ive had to create a listened-too list for this not an issue for music because whatever but for podcasts this is a huge goof i should be able to see on one screen the last 100 podcasts ive listened too bug it stops playing no reason,0
its is the best app for music,1

spotify is a great  streaming service their song library is very extensive,1
all of a sudden i cannot pause or skip  the playback bar is gone  very annoying im going to delete spotify and cancel account if this isnt fixed ,0

i cant even pay for premium lol dont yall want some money or something i had already reinstall this app and still cant pay for premium,0
i like this app and i dont have premium but it still works fine the only reason i rated this a 3 was because the ads the ads are terrible and will literally happen in the middle of a song but other than that i recommend,1

i love spotify ive been using it for something around 3-4 years and have personally not really had any problems and i use this app almost everyday its easy to use you can find some really good artists and songs just by listening to your discover weekly which recommends you songs based off what you have been listening to,1
spotify has everything i like to listen to and more create your own playlists mix and match music to satisfy your mood my 1 go to when i hit the highways and just wanna hear it all,1

this app is done finally uninstalled because i got sick of the app i was trying to play songs but three freaking suggested songs after three ads im so annoyed with this app wish it could be zero stars,0
what is up with all these updates there is literally an update every other day just make one big update and leave it alone for a bit i feel that everytime i want to listen to music i need to update it first literally your last update was on june 19th and there was just another one today on june 23rd think of these updates all at once if you can cause all these constant ones are just annoying at this point i love listening to music on this app but i feel im doing more updating than listening,0
the play bar disappears sometimes and other times i cant stop the audio,0
great app it have slowed reverb songs and the bad thing about this app is it is it have more advertisements then other apps,0
recently buggy the song plays but theres no controls for it from anywhere so theres music playing but visually theres no way to tell that anything is playing nothing in the app nothing on the notification bar sometimes stops playing songs randomly my friends have the same issue,0
fix your app i have been using spotify since 2014 and now since 2021 i have issues with spotify mobile the downloads automatically delete themself when you turn off or restart your phone the recommendations of a playlist are broken since you reach 500 songs in one playlist and now my session get randomly closed when i close the app,0

i really like this app compared to all other music streaming apps i gave 4 starsif there was a way to earn replays i would give 5 stars thanks for the music ,1
you dont get to listen to the song you want until you skip like 30 different songs,0
i will never pay for an app that doesnt allows you to change the order of the tracks on the playlist its ridiculous even in yt free you can choose the order,0
this app is good i like it because what ever song i love that will come and than i can liston and lircs can also have but so many ads when liston 1 song than 2 song so that ads come that why i have give 4 start but thanks u made this spotify app thanks a lot,1
quite useful and entertaining however there are some downsights for instance not being able to listening to unpopular musics or the special covers of the musics are limited most of the time what i mean is the song variety is not the way that i want it to be other than that the best music app which provides the suprerior sound quality among the others,0
when i press the music it just play the simple part of the song,0
one of the best app for music no one beat spotify,1
its an amazing app its definitely my favourite music app i did have a small problem though i bought premium and cancelled a month after in the playstore because i wanted even though it was amazing and it didnt cancell it took around 22 out of my account if you want to cancel please do it on the app,1
in my personal opinion version 8587921 has the best setup after i updated it to the newest version i could no longer listen to playlists in order not even my own it got so bad i reverted to version 8587921 just go back to that versions setup and fix coding issues after i really hate the new setup and its really a shame you changed it,0
personal playlists tend to play same songs over and over even when on shuffle despite the fact there are 1000s of songs in my personal playlists,0

intermittent bluetooth connection sort it out also please remove that trash pop up get the best spotify experience on android 12 dont overcomplicate things more than it needs to be its a music app its not that deep ffs,0
whats wrong with this app i have a good internet connection and yet the bloody apps could not load any list of songs,0
i have spotify premium and i can completely recommend it the algorithm is very good i discovered so many artists and songs thanks to him the design is simple and pretty the app has a lot of features and is very intuitive to use i never had any technical problems either,1
removed all the basic features in resent updates,0
i pay for no ads and unlimited skips definitely worth it thoughmy liked list has almost 2000 songs so its definitely worth paying for i hate commercials and if i dont feel like a song i can skip,1
needs signal to work even if its an episode i downloaded i travel a lot and its become very aggravating if its already playing an episode its not a problem but if i turn the app on with low reception it doesnt work if it wasnt for specific content i want access to id delete it,0
ver good songs app in every language,1
beneficial whilst having my long bathlistening to history of rome padcast,1
ads get annoying but otherwise good,1
normally its five out of five stars the most recent update to spotify causes the application to close after 4-5 songs and after the first crash it crashes again after relaunch it honestly feels like a memory leak issues with chrome on windows,0
uninstalled why because automatically plays after ive paused it closed it and ended the program from running in the background it starts playing after my phone connects to my bluetooth infuriating,0
i consider my musical taste as extremely eclectic spotify allows me to indulge in my eclecticism for you to appreciate what i mean check out my playlist eclectic images on spotify,1
